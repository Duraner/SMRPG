{0543}	 You know, I hate to admit it...[1] But I LOVE this job![0]
{0544}	  [1] What are you looking for?[0]
{0545}	[1]                 Yeah!!![0]
{0546}	[1]             Thanks a bunch.[0]
{0547}	 Hey Mario![1] My brother's waiting[1] for you upstairs![0]
{0548}	RAZ: Say hey, Mario![1] Guess what?[12]...[12][2] Raini isn't just a “friend”[1] anymore. We're getting married.[0]
{0549}	RAZ: Yeah, she's right.[1] I guess we can put it off until[1] things cool down around here.[0]
{0550}	TOAD: Mario, there you are![1] I'll tell the Chancellor you're here.[2] I'll wait for you down the hallway.[0]
{0551}	[1]            This way, please.[0]
{0552}	[1]                Hey, chill![0]
{0553}	[1]      Didn't I tell you to CHILL?![0]
{0554}	[1]        Sir, Mario has arrived![0]
{0555}	CHANCELLOR: Mario![1] Thank goodness you're here! [0]
{0556}	 We heard an explosion or something[1] at Bowser's Keep. It was so loud[1] I almost dropped my spores!!![0]
{0557}	 Uh...excuse me? W...where's the[1] Princess? She departed for your[1] house HOURS ago...![0]
{0558}	 I fear the worst! Could Bowser[1] somehow be behind all of this?[0]
{0559}	CHANCELLOR: Spores alive!!![1] You're telling us that Bowser has[1] abducted the Princess AGAIN?[0]
{0560}	 Things are ALWAYS happening to[1] her! What an UNLUCKY child![0]
{0561}	 Nevermind. It will be up to you to[1] enter the keep and rescue[1] Princess Toadstool![0]
{0562}	CHANCELLOR: Egad![1] The keep is unassailable?! What[1] awful power is at work here?![0]
{0563}	 Mario...her life is in your hands.[1] Please, save our dear Princess![0]
{0564}	[1]   We know you won't let us down![0]
{0565}	[1]  So long Mario....and good luck![0]
{0566}	TOAD: Where could the Princess be?[1] We're all counting on you[1] to find her, Mario![0]
{0567}	[1]            Come back here!![0]
{0568}	CHANCELLOR: All we can do is[1] wait here. Don't let us down![0]
{0569}	CHANCELLOR: On your way now![0]
{0570}	 Y, yes?...[12]Gee, you're soaking[1] wet, aren't you?[0]
{0571}	 I'm all right now. Sorry...[1] There's nothing like a good cry![2] [12]But,[12] why was I crying?[5][6]
{0572}	 Oh, no! That REPTILE[1] stole my Grandpa's coin![0]
{0573}	[4] B...boo hoo...sniffle...[2] I can't cry. Big boys don't cry.[12][1] But it's just not fair...![3][1] What am I gonna do? Waaaaaah!!![0]
{0574}	 My Grandpa asked me to buy some[1] things for him here. When I walked[1] into town, that croc stopped me![0]
{0575}	 Oh yeah! He took it from me![1] He stole my coin! I chased[1] him, but he's way too fast...[0]
{0576}	 Mario![1] Let's see how you're going[1] to take care of Bowser![6]
{0577}	[4] Wow![1] He doesn't stand a chance![0]
{0578}	 It was that reptile! He's the[1] one who stole my wallet...![0]
{0579}	[1] ...but I let him get away...[0]
{0580}	 Dunno what that reptile's up to,[1] but[12]...[12] MAN, can he JUMP![0]
{0581}	 Wow! You're THE Mario? I know[1] all about you! You've got more[1] JUMP in you than a box of frogs![0]
{0582}	[4] I'm Mallow from Tadpole Pond.[1] I'm a frog, but can you believe it?[1] I can't jump. Embarrassing huh?[0]
{0583}	[4] How about it, Mario![1] Will you help me catch that[1] filthy thief?[2] [7]  (Sure thing)[1] [7]  (I'm a little busy)[0]
{0584}	     The young frog, Mallow, who[1]      doesn't look AT ALL like a[1]    frog, joins Mario in his quest.[0]
{0585}	 You're sure you won't reconsider?[2] [7]  (All right, I'll help you)[1] [7]  (Sorry)[0]
{0586}	 Oh, please[12][12]...[1] Pretty please?[2] [7]  (Okay, okay...)[1] [7]  (NO!)[0]
{0587}	[4] I never thought you'd be[1] so mean, Mario.[0]
{0588}	 Who cares if you can JUMP?[1] Being mean is soooo UNCOOL![0]
{0589}	MALLOW: You know I can't get my[1] coin back without your help.[2] [7]  (All right, already)[1] [7]  (No means NO!)[0]
{0590}	 A lot of creepy looking thugs[1] have been sneaking into town...[1] Not on MY watch!![0]
{0591}	 Rain or shine, I stand watch![2] But this is getting ridiculous![0]
{0592}	 But this is getting ridiculous![0]
{0593}	[1] There was SOME reason[12][12]...[0]
{0594}	MALLOW: Did he look something[12][12][1] ...like[12][12]...this?[0]
{0595}	[1]          Why, yes! Exactly![0]
{0596}	MALLOW: He's the one who took my[1] coin! Why didn't you stop him?[0]
{0597}	 Because I forgot my bazooka[1] at home! [12]Sheesh...[12][12][1] [12][12]Give me a break, here.[0]
{0598}	CROCO: Har, har! Youse mugs'll[1] NEVER catch me! A snail could[1] outrun YOU morons! Later![0]
{0599}	 Mario![1] I have something to report, sir.[0]
{0600}	 I saw him! He's here somewhere![1] He just zoomed past me a[1] second ago. Did you see him?[0]
{0601}	MALLOW: That's HIMMMMM![1] Hurry, Mario, let's get him![0]
{0602}	 Rain or shine,[1] I shall fulfill my duty.[0]
{0603}	 Rain or shine,[1] I shall fulfill my duty.[0]
{0604}	[1]   I'll remain here on the lookout![0]
{0605}	 So I guess Princess Toadstool[1] really WAS kidnapped by Bowser.[0]
{0606}	 You'll catch your death of cold![1] Come on, let's dry off.[0]
{0607}	 But I wanna play outside!![0]
{0608}	 Hey, what do you think[1] you're doing?![1] Get off of there this minute![0]
{0609}	 All right now, let's start again.[1] Go in FRONT of the counter[1] and talk to me.[0]
{0610}	 It's raining hammer handles and[1] pitchforks out there![0]
{0611}	 Hey, Mallow![1] What kept you?[1] I was starting to worry.[0]
{0612}	MALLOW: Wait until you hear this![1] You see[12][12]...[12]...[0]
{0613}	 Wait...I've already heard...[1] Old Frogfucius told me. He seems[1] to know EVERYTHING! Hold on.[0]
{0614}	MALLOW: Listen...[2] The truth of the matter is, well,[1][12] ...um...[12]the coin was stolen.[0]
{0615}	 WHAT?! [13][48]Well, if that's[1] the case, I guess we can't trade.[1] What a shame, huh?![0]
{0616}	MALLOW: Oh, but there's[1] no need to worry![1] Mario, here, will help us out![0]
{0617}	 'Zat so? Well, if Mario's on your[1] team, you'll have that coin back[1] in a jiffy![0]
{0618}	 Not so fast! Take this with you.[1] You'll probably need it.[0]
{0619}	[1]  Where do ya think everyone went?[0]
{0620}	 Well, gang, looks like we have[1] ourselves a new home![0]
{0621}	 We can bounce around all[1] day long! And there's no one[1] here who can stand in our way![0]
{0622}	 Yahoo![1] Let's bounce the night away![0]
{0623}	[1]          NOT SO FAST, PAL![0]
{0624}	 Look at him! Can't even bounce![1] Hey, maybe we could bounce ON[1] HIS HEAD!!!![0]
{0625}	MACK: Listen up, gang![2] These guys are gonna put[1] a stop to OUR party![2] Are we happy about this?![0]
{0626}	[1]         You're asking for IT![0]
{0627}	[1]       Ooh, you're gonna get it![0]
{0628}	 You picked the WRONG people[1] not to bounce with, bub![0]
{0629}	 How 'bout a fat lip to go with[1] that ugly mustache?![0]
{0630}	CHANCELLOR: Mario![0]
{0631}	 Once again, Mario to the rescue![5][6]
{0632}	[4][1]         But who WERE those...[0]
{0633}	TOAD: Chancellor![0]
{0634}	 Look! SCARY THINGS!![1] Get RID of them!![0]
{0635}	CHANCELLOR: First the Princess[1] and now THIS![1] It's just too much to bear.[0]
{0636}	 Mario! Please! You MUST[1] rescue the Princess, NOW![0]
{0637}	MALLOW: Mario![0]
{0638}	MALLOW: How about we ask my[1] Grandpa for help?...[5][6]
{0639}	[1] He knows...EVERYTHING![0]
{0640}	             Could Mack,[2]    the sword-like monster who[1]  crashed into Mushroom Kingdom,[1]    have anything to do with the[2]  Star Piece that Mario found...?[3]    Our heroes move on towards[1]          the Kero Sewers...[0]
{0641}	CHANCELLOR: Gracious![13][64][1] OH! It's YOU, Mario.[1] What a relief![0]
{0642}	MALLOW: Mario![1] I'm in your debt, too.[2] Let's head over to Grandpa's place[1] in Tadpole Pond. He can help![0]
{0643}	TOAD: Sir![1] Thank goodness you're all right![5][6]
{0644}	[1] Mario! So it was YOU who[1] got us through all of this![1] We owe much to you...![0]
{0645}	CHANCELLOR: Excuse me, but...[1] who are YOU?[0]
{0646}	MALLOW: Oh, hello![1] My name is Mallow. I'm from[1] Tadpole Pond...[0]
{0647}	CHANCELLOR: Well, any friend of[1] Mario's is welcome here in[1] Mushroom Kingdom.[5][6]
{0648}	[4] As I was saying, Mario, you[1] are our only hope![0]
{0649}	 Help!![0]
{0650}	 I'm guarding the Treasure Room.[1] Sorry, but you'll have to get the[1] Chancellor's permission to pass.[0]
{0651}	[1]         Hey, HEY! wrong way.[0]
{0652}	 Oh, I found this in the cellar.[1] Here, you can have it.[0]
{0653}	 Oh, I found this in the cellar.[1] Here, you can have it.[0]
{0654}	 Oh, I found this in the cellar.[1] Here, you can have it.[0]
{0655}	 I guard the vault.[1] No one takes our treasure![0]
{0656}	 That Vault...Guard![1] I come here to save him and[1] he runs into the next room![2] Well, so much for him.[0]
{0657}	[1]               I'm scared![0]
{0658}	 What ARE those things[1] out there, anyway?![0]
{0659}	 OH NO![1] The Chancellor's still in the[1] throne room![0]
{0660}	[1]  I'm too scared to pass by them![0]
{0661}	[1]             Trapped again![0]
{0662}	 Saved by Mario again! How could[1] I ever thank you enough?![0]
{0663}	 You're in one piece![0]
{0664}	TOAD: Thanks to Mario, of course![0]
{0665}	TOAD: What?! That's terrible![0]
{0666}	 But, with Mario around,[12]...[1] we're...[12]safe, right?[2] [7]  (You bet)[1] [7]  (I wouldn't be so sure)[0]
{0667}	TOAD: (gasping)...Mario..[1] I'm..sorry I'm...late. I was [1] caught up...in some business.[3] So, shall we head off to the[1] Chancellor's place now?[0]
{0668}	 That was TOO darn close.[1] Thanks for the hand, Mario.[0]
{0669}	 Hey! THAT'S the wallet the[1] crocodile swiped from me![1] Can I have it back?[2] [7]  (Sure)[1] [7]  (No way)[0]
{0670}	[4][1]     Why, you're as bad as he is![0]
{0671}	[4] Thank you so much! Here,[1] I'll give you this as a reward.[1] Go on now, take it.[0]
{0672}	 Hey, give me back my wallet![2] [7]  (All right, quit whining)[1] [7]  (NO WAY, Jose!)[0]
{0673}	 There's a lot of noise out there[1] today.[0]
{0674}	[1]               Oh, wow...![0]
{0675}	[1]     I'm shaken, but not stirred![0]
{0676}	 It's scary outside, so let's play[1] indoors, all right?[0]
{0677}	 It's so nice to see our young ones[1] having a good time![0]
{0678}	RAINI: Do you happen to know of[1] a good wedding chapel?[0]
{0679}	RAINI: I found the perfect place[1] for a wedding! But now we're all[1] stuck inside![0]
{0680}	[1]           Thank you, Mario![0]
{0681}	 I just can't get this meal to look[1] like the picture in my cookbook.[0]
{0682}	 You may NOT sleep in the Princess'[1] bed. Have you no manners?[0]
{0683}	MALLOW: Hey, mister![5][1] I got my coin back![0]
{0684}	 Oh! Well DONE, lad![1] Okay, here's the thing[1] I promised you...[0]
{0685}	 There! Make sure it doesn't get[1] stolen, eaten, or...whatever![1] Your Grandpa needs it, okay?[0]
{0686}	MALLOW: You bet![5][6]
{0687}	 Excuse me?![3] You want to...WHAT? How can[1] you shop at a time like this?![3] Just...take what you want and[1] leave some money behind...[0]
{0688}	 The Princess hasn't returned yet.[1] Can you imagine how the[2] Chancellor must feel?[0]
{0689}	 I'm shaken and stirred but still[1] standing.[0]
{0690}	 The Vault Guard better not be[1] goofing off while I'm cleaning[1] the guest room![0]
{0691}	 Thanks, Mario. I'll continue to[1] stand watch, but now EVERYONE[1] seems suspicious![2] By the way, look what I found.[0]
{0692}	[1]            Thanks, Mario![0]
{0693}	 Boing, boing, boing![1] Now THIS guy can JUMP![0]
{0694}	[1]     I can still jump the highest![0]
{0695}	 So, what did you find?[0]
{0696}	[1]            This way, please.[0]
{0697}	[1]     Hope my little brother is OK.[0]
{0698}	 There we go, now! Hey wait...[2] Hang on for a sec, okay?[0]
{0699}	TOAD: Please take this.[1] The Princess would be happy to[1] know you have something of hers.[0]
{0700}	            Gained 1 Flower![0]
{0701}	 Yeah, you're right...[1] I'm asking for too much...[0]
{0702}	TOAD: Good luck, Mario![1] Give 'em heck![0]
{0703}	[1]  But what about my son upstairs?[0]
{0704}	 Oops![13][48][1] I forgot all about him![0]
{0705}	[1]   I'm really worried about my son.[0]
{0706}	 Really, thank you so much for[1] EVERYTHING![0]
{0707}	 You're going to grow up to be just[1] like Mario, you hear?[0]
{0708}	[1]            This is not good![0]
{0709}	[1]    The mustachioed one is strong![0]
{0710}	[1]             Strong, YES![0]
{0711}	[1]       We MUST warn the boss![0]
{0712}	[1]                Come on!![0]
{0713}	[1]            Chop chop chop...[0]
{0714}	 Hurry and find the Princess![1] We're getting too stressed out![0]
{0715}	 The Princess' room is up ahead.[1] Don't you go snooping through[1] her things, though.[0]
{0716}	        Found Toadstool's ???[0]
{0717}	 Hey there!![1] What do you think you're doing?[0]
{0718}	 The Princess' room is up ahead.[1] Were you caught trying to steal[1] something?[2] [7]  (Are you kidding?!)[1] [7]  (How did you know?)[0]
{0719}	[4] You musn't lie.[1] I know what you've been up to.[0]
{0720}	[4] Honesty is one of your finest[1] qualities, Mario.[0]
{0721}	 I'll give you this in exchange.[1] Just leave everything[1] where it was![0]
{0722}	 Let's refrain from searching[1] through other peoples' things![0]
{0723}	 It doesn't seem like the Princess[1] is THAT far away.[1] I can almost feel her presence.[0]
{0724}	 Was the Princess kidnapped by[1] those THINGS outside?[1] Are THEY a part of this?[0]
{0725}	 Help the people in the castle, and[1] they just might help you![0]
{0726}	 Trample the monsters![1] Smash 'em all! It'll do ya good.[2] Trust me[5]...on THIS ONE.[0]
{0727}	[1]    Thanks for saving my brother.[0]
{0728}	[1] Mario, thank you so much![2] Grandpa will be delighted![0]
{0729}	 EEK! There are...THINGS[1] in our kitchen. HELP!!!![0]
{0730}	[1] Here's a little token of my[1] appreciation![0]
{0731}	 The Princess is back![1] I humble myself before you![0]
{0732}	TOADSTOOL: Good luck, Mario![0]
{0733}	TOADSTOOL: Grandma,...[1] thanks for putting up with all my[1] selfish demands.[0]
{0734}	TOADSTOOL: Mario's beside me![1] Everything's going to be all right.[1] So don't worry, OK?[0]
{0735}	 I feel like I'm growing younger[1] just talking with you people![0]
{0736}	 Mario, HELP!![0]
{0737}	 Mwa ha ha...hey Mario![1] I'll be taking care of[1] Princess Toadstool now.[0]
{0738}	 Boing, boing...[2] SUPER JUMP ATTACK!![0]
{0739}	 Guwa ha! You think you can hurt[1] me with your childish pranks?![0]

{0749}	 Well, you have the hat...[1] AND the funky 'stache...![1] Are you really Mario?![2] [7]  (You betcha!)[1] [7]  (Wrong number!)[0]
{0750}	[4] How do I know it's you?[1] You might just be pulling my leg![2] Show me! PROVE IT![6]
{0751}	[4] All right!![2] Hey Mario, wanna play with me?[1] I'm playing “Save the world!”[0]
{0752}	[4] Awwww, you're a fake.[2] Well, you'll have to do...[2] Let's play my[12]...[12]“Geno” game![0]
{0753}	GAZ: YES!![1] “Mario” just bought the farm, so[1] um...you can be “Bowser”...[2] I'll be “Geno,” okay?[0]
{0754}	GAZ: Ready?[1] Let's play from where I left off![5][6]
{0755}	GAZ: Ooh, scary![1] But just watch ME![0]
{0756}	 Now, Gaz...![1] Mario might be a little tired, dear.[0]
{0757}	GAZ: Awwww, come on, mom![1] YOU never play with me!...[1] It's no fun playing alone.[0]
{0758}	 Oh dear[12]...Mario, I hate to [1] ask, but... Could you play [1] with Gaz for a little while?[0]
{0759}	[1] All set?[0]
{0760}	GAZ: Better watch out, Bowser,[1] cause Geno's gonna blow you away![1] TAKE THIS![0]
{0761}	GAZ: Your turn, Bowser![0]
{0762}	GAZ: Owwww...Oh no, if he keeps[1] this up, I'm finished![1] All right, you asked for it![0]
{0763}	 The super duper...[2] Custom, patented, one and only...[1] SHOOTING STAR SHOT!![0]
{0764}	GAZ: Oops...[12][1] I...[12]uh...[12]I think I...missed.[0]
{0765}	 Oh dear, oh my![1] Mario, are you all right?[0]
{0766}	 Hi Mario. Staying for a nap?[2] [7]  (Sure)[1] [7]  (Maybe next time)[0]
{0767}	[4] Don't worry. It's on the house.[1] I mean, you were so kind to Gaz.[0]
{0768}	[4][1]    Stop by anytime now, you hear?[0]
{0769}	GAZ: Mom! You'll never believe[1] what I just saw...[0]
{0770}	GAZ: It was amazing, mom![1] [5]I just saw Geno walk[1] into the forest! Neat, huh?[0]
{0771}	 Yes, dear. That's nice, dear...[1] And isn't Geno the one who broke[1] my lamp the other day?[0]
{0772}	GAZ: Awww, ma, that was just,[1] well, you know...[1] Now THIS WAS REAL![0]
{0773}	 I SWEAR, Mom, REALLY![1] It's true! I SAW HIM outside![0]
{0774}	 All right, Gaz, let's hear it![1] What are you trying to get out of[1] this time, hmmm?[0]
{0775}	GAZ: Mom, I didn't DO anything.[1] I really, TRULY saw Geno walking[1] into the forest![0]
{0776}	 Mario! How are we feeling?[2] [7]  (Like a new man!)[1] [7]  (Need coffee. Keep away.)[0]
{0777}	 Well, that's good to hear.[1] Thank you so much for spending[1] time with Gaz.[2] He just loved it![0]
{0778}	 Yes, you look awful![1] Why don't you rest some more?[0]
{0779}	GAZ: S...Sorry if I hurt you![1] But...what would Geno want[1] in the forest?[0]
{0780}	GAZ: Sorry I knocked you down[1] a while ago.[3] Geno...doesn't know his own[1] strength![0]
{0781}	GAZ: Oh NO![0]
{0782}	[1]     Oh! This boy is IMPOSSIBLE![0]
{0783}	 There's a stairway that leads[1] to my house, but my son's been[1] playing with the controls again![3] Mario, only you could jump up[1] there!  Please...help me get back[1] up to my house![0]
{0784}	 I wanna go someplace fun![1] Standing around here[1] is soooo bo-oring![0]
{0785}	[1]                  OUCH![0]
{0786}	[1]                 Be quiet![0]
{0787}	 See, arrows come flying out[1] from the forest...and when you're[1] hit, you can't move! See, look![2] I can't move a muscle. Now I know[1] how a scarecrow feels![0]
{0788}	 Since the day a shooting star fell[1] into the forest, arrows have been[1] showering our town![0]
{0789}	 I tell you, it's scary out here, but[1] someone's got to pump the water.[0]
{0790}	 My husband still hasn't come back![1] I wonder what's keeping him?[0]
{0791}	 Thanks a million, Mario![1] Say[12][12],...[12][12]were my treasures OK?[2] [7]  (They sure were)[1] [7]  (I wouldn't say so)[0]
{0792}	 Thanks a million, Mario![1] Say[12][12],...[12][12]were my treasures OK?[2] [7]  (They sure were)[1] [7]  (I wouldn't say so)[0]
{0793}	 Say[12][12],...[12][12]were my treasures OK?[2] [7]  (They sure were)[1] [7]  (I wouldn't say so)[0]
{0794}	 Oh! That's great news![1] What a relief![0]
{0795}	 WHAT?! THEY'RE GONE?![1] MARIO, you're the only one who[1] can reach THEM![2] [7]  (Sorry, I got carried away)[1] [7]  (I don't know anything)[0]
{0796}	[1]             You're kidding!![0]
{0797}	[1]            They're just fine.[0]
{0798}	[4] Oh, well...[13][64][1] ...since we didn't get hit by any[1] arrows, I'll tell you a secret.[3] Enter the forest. When you hit an[1] area with 4 paths, go left, left,[1] straight, right- in that order.[2] You'll surely find something [5]NICE.[0]
{0799}	[1] ...since we didn't get hit by any[1] arrows, I'll tell you a secret.[3] Enter the forest. When you hit an[1] area with 4 paths, go left, left,[1] straight, right- in that order.[2] You'll surely find something [5]NICE.[0]
{0800}	 Enter the forest. When you hit an[1] area with 4 paths, go left, left,[1] straight, right- in that order.[2] You'll surely find something [5]NICE.[0]
{0801}	[4][1]            Oh, just curious...[0]
{0802}	[4][1]            Oh, just curious...[0]
{0803}	[4] There are 2 kinds of mushrooms.[1] One terrorizes people and the other[1] helps people. Avoid the former.[0]
{0804}	[4][1]     All right, I'll take your word.[0]
{0805}	 Excuse me, I didn't hear you?[1] [7]  (I'm so sorry)[1] [7]  (I said I don't know)[0]
{0806}	[4] You already found 'em, huh?[1] That's fantastic! Here, why don't[1] you take this along with you?[0]
{0807}	 You've found the treasure![1] Way to GO![1] Keep up the good work![0]
{0808}	 What's taking Daddy so long...?[2] Do you think he's still looking for[1] the treasure?[0]
{0809}	 Button? Yeah, I jumped on it.[1] I do it all the time.[1] It really winds my Dad up![0]
{0810}	 Mario![1] Good to have a customer at last.[1] What do you need?[0]
{0811}	 Hello Mario. It's so nice[1] of you to drop by the shop.[1] What can I do for you?[0]
{0812}	 Found me, huh? What are you doing[1] walking around HERE, though?[1] You must be pretty bored...[0]
{0813}	[1]           I... I can't move![0]
{0814}	 Oh, this is NOT GOOD...[1] Now I can't go to the forest to[1] chop up any wood.[0]
{0815}	 Just you wait...[0]
{0816}	 We're told not to go outside[1] 'cuz it's too dangerous.[0]
{0817}	 Grandpa's pumping some water for[1] us. I wish we could help, too...[0]
{0818}	 I'm worried about my grandson.[1] He went out to play, but didn't[1] come back when he should have.[0]
{0819}	TOAD: Mario! I hate to bother[1] you while you're resting, but I[1] wanted to deliver this to you.[0]
{0820}	 You know what's really weird?[1] I just saw a doll dressed in a blue[1] cape walking towards the forest.[0]
{0821}	 A...walking doll? Yeah, sure pal![1] I think you need some help.[1] Now SCRAM![0]
{0822}	[1] Okay, hit as many as you can![1] Ready?[13][48]...GO![13][48][6]
{0823}	GAZ: Geno! You came back![0]
{0824}	GAZ: SEE, Mom? THIS is the Geno[1] I was talking about![0]
{0825}	 My, my, what a fabulous costume![1] It must be kind of hot for the[1] person wearing it, though.[0]
{0826}	GAZ: Awww, forget it, mom.[0]
{0827}	[1] All right, Geno, let's play![0]
{0828}	GENO: How I wish I could![1] But Mario and I must leave now[1] to find...[2] ...the missing Star Pieces...[0]
{0829}	GAZ: Star Pieces? You mean like[1] shooting stars? What for?[0]
{0830}	GENO: Well...[1] How can I explain this[12]...[12][0]
{0831}	GENO: Well Gaz,...[1] it's like this...[13][32][6]
{0832}	 Well, good luck![0]
{0833}	[4]Time    [28][0][1]Points [28][1][6]
{0834}	[4]Time    [28][0][1]Points [28][1][6]
{0835}	[4]Time    [28][0][1]Points [28][1][6]
{0836}	 It's easier if ya stand[1] in the middle.[6]
{0837}	 That was SOME thumping![1] Here's your prize! Next time,[1] try and get [28][0] pts.[0]
{0838}	[1]     You can do better than that![0]
{0839}	[4][1]              Then SCRAM![0]
{0840}	 Looks like you've got[1] yourself a tough road ahead.[1] Good luck![0]
{0841}	 [1] This is how it used to be,[2] but now...it's like...[13][32][6]
{0842}	 THIS![1] Do you get it?[0]
{0843}	GAZ: Uh uh... NOPE![2] You lost me.[0]
{0844}	GENO: Well, let's just say that if[1] things stay the way they are, your[1] wishes will never come true.[0]
{0845}	GAZ: WHAT?! So you mean even if[1] I grow up, I won't ever be strong[1] and cool like you?![0]
{0846}	GENO: No one's wishes will come[1] true until the Star Pieces are[1] found and the Star Road repaired.[0]
{0847}	[4] Which is why I have chosen to[1] join these two in order to find[1] the missing Star Pieces.[0]
{0848}	GAZ: So that's it...[12]...[12]![1] Well, Mario needs all the help[1] he can get![0]
{0849}	[4] Geno, I have a lot of dreams![1] Please, go fix the Star Road and[1] make sure they all come true![0]
{0850}	GENO: That's a promise![0]
{0851}	GAZ: COOL!![0]
{0852}	GAZ: Oh, wait!  Wait a minute![0]
{0853}	GAZ: This is yours, Geno, so take[1] it along with you.[0]
{0854}	GAZ: Go get 'em, Geno![1] You're the main man![0]
{0855}	GAZ: It's gonna be a little lonely[1] without you, but...hey, I can[1] handle it.[0]
{0856}	GENO: Thanks for being a good[1] sport, Gaz. I'll see you when I[1] get back.[0]
{0857}	[1] Mommy![0]
{0858}	 I can finally move![2] I guess I owe it all to Mario...[1] What an amazing guy![0]
{0859}	[1]            I'm finally HOME![0]
{0860}	 Can't believe we had arrows[1] showering down around here...[0]
{0861}	 Good, now I can finally go to the[1] forest to chop some wood.[0]
{0862}	 I'm so proud of my Grandson.[1] Just look at him.[0]
{0863}	 My Grandson has come back home[1] in one piece. Thank you, Mario![0]
{0864}	 There's nothing to worry about[1] anymore! I can finally relax.[0]
{0865}	 Phew..[12]..[12] That was close,[1] but I made it on time...[12]..[12][0]
{0866}	[4][1]                 [28][1] points[6]
{0867}	[1]          Hey, I'll carry that![0]
{0868}	 Hi, Mario! Bet you're gonna be[1] pretty busy from here on.[1] What can I get you?[0]
{0869}	 I thought I heard a big boom over[1] from the mountains. Hmmmm, guess[1] I'm starting to hear things...[0]
{0870}	 Things are finally back to[1] normal. Thank you, Mario.[0]
{0871}	 Thanks, Mario! Now we can all go[1] outside and do what we want[1] without worrying.[0]
{0872}	 Be careful, hon.[0]
{0873}	 Come back again, you hear?[1] Have you been to Yo'ster Isle?[2] [7]  (You betcha)[1] [7]  (Nope, not yet)[0]
{0874}	[4] Oh, I see...[2] So you've tried your luck with the[1] Goomba thumping game, huh?[0]
{0875}	[4] You have to go through the[1] pipes to get there![0]
{0876}	 Now I can finally move. Maybe I'll[1] go pick mushrooms in the forest.[2] It's a little scary, but I'll take my[1] chances.[0]
{0877}	 Wait[12][12]...[1] Why did I even come to Mushroom[1] Kingdom in the first place?[5][6]
{0878}	[1] Guess I'll find out soon enough.[0]
{0879}	[4] Hey, if you're out of cash,[1] better learn to stash.[0]
{0880}	CHANCELLOR: Oh, Mario!...[1] There's something important[1] I need to discuss with you.[0]
{0881}	 That Hammer you got...you've[1] equipped it, right?[0]
{0882}	[1]   You're all set for your journey?[0]
{0883}	[4] Shall I have Toad explain the[1] process?[2] [7]  (Yes, please)[1] [7]  (Absolutely no need at all)[0]
{0884}	[4]TOAD: You will “equip” things[1] using the menu.[2] Please press the “X” Button.[6]
{0885}	CHANCELLOR: There, now I feel[1] more at ease.[1] Now it's all up to you.[0]
{0886}	  [4]CHANCELLOR: I see. Well then,[2] NEVER forget to equip new[1] weapons and armor![1] Farewell and good luck![0]
{0887}	 Oh, and take this along with you.[2] It should help you out.[0]
{0888}	[1] You take care, Grandma,[1] you hear?[0]
{0889}	 Hey![12][12]...[12][12]You gave it to someone![2] You're gonna get it![0]
{0890}	 You're gonna get it![0]
{0891}	 (Congratulations![1]  Yoshi came in first![1]  A prize goes to the winner!)[0]
{0892}	 (Congratulations![1]  Yoshi came in first![1]  A prize goes to the winner!)[0]
{0893}	 (Oh, you were SO close![1]  Too bad Yoshi lost...[1]  Let's race again, sometime.)[0]
{0894}	 (Sorry.[1]  Yoshi lost...[1]  Better luck next time.)[0]
{0895}	[1]                  GOAL![13][48][6]

{0899}	[4][1]         (All right, see ya...)[0]
{0900}	YOSHI: (Come on, hop aboard!)[0]
{0901}	 (Boshi here is the fastest runner[1]  ...but he's full of himself!)[0]
{0902}	 (Boshi only races one-on-one[1]  so everyone can't join us.[1]  Bummer!)[0]
{0903}	 (What? Are you cracked?[1]  Racing's my life![1]  I could run all day!)[0]
{0904}	[1] (Careful, don't step on the eggs.)[0]
{0905}	 (Hey, Yoshi! [5]Think you can[1]  beat the old Boshi today?)[2]  [7] (Of course)[1]  [7] (No, not today)[0]
{0906}	BOSHI: (What're YOU lookin' at?[2] If you wanna challenge me,[1] you have to bring Cookies!)[0]
{0907}	BOSHI: (SO! You brought the[1] Cookies. All right![2] Consider yourself lucky today.[2] You've got yourself a race...[1] One-on-one!)[0]
{0908}	BOSHI:[1] (This is as easy as it gets, man.)[0]
{0909}	[1]      (That can't happen twice!)[0]
{0910}	BOSHI: (Come back when you're[1] SERIOUS! Now, I think those[1] Cookies there belong to ME!)[0]
{0911}	BOSHI: (Come back when you're[1] SERIOUS! Now, I think those[1] Cookies there belong to ME!)[0]
{0912}	 (Wow! Unbelievable![2]  You just beat BOSHI!)[0]
{0913}	 (Starting today, Yoshi's[1]  the new BOSS around HERE!)[0]
{0914}	YOSHI: (But we don't need a BOSS![1] Anyway, I just want to race!)[0]
{0915}	YOSHI: (Come on, Boshi![1] Let's see what you're made of!)[0]
{0916}	BOSHI: (Hmmm...[13][48]All right![1] Just stay outta my way![2] Oh, here's the Cookie stash[1] for the winner.)[0]
{0917}	YOSHI: (Thanks to you, Mario,[12][12][1]  I finally beat that rascal! And[1] we can all race together now!)[0]
{0918}	YOSHI: (Here's something to[1] remember me by!)[0]
{0919}	 (Next time you're in trouble[1]  during battle, use this to[1]  give me a call.)[0]
{0920}	            Found a Cookie![6]
{0921}	 (It would be so much better if we[1]  could all race together!)[0]
{0922}	TOAD: Hello again! Get ready, the[1] “Mushroom Derby” is coming up.[2] Want instructions?[2] [7]  (Sure!)[1] [7]  (No thanks)[0]
{0923}	[4][1]           (See you around!)[0]
{0924}	[4] Keep alternating between the A[1] Button and the B Button in time[1] with the beat! Let's practice![0]
{0925}	One [6]
{0926}	Two [6]
{0927}	Three [6]
{0928}	                 Got it![6]
{0929}	Two [0]
{0930}	[4] You're not getting it right at all.[1] Are you sure you want to do this?[2] [7]  (I'll practice again)[1] [7]  (Race Time!)[0]
{0931}	[4] You still have some problems.[1] Come on! CONCENTRATE![2] [7]  (I'll practice some more)[1] [7]  (RACE TIME!)[0]
{0932}	[4][1]     There you go, that's the way![0]
{0933}	[4][1]    Now, shall we go to the race?[0]
{0934}	YOSHI: (Looks like I need a little[1] more practice. Oh, well...[1] let's try it again sometime.)[0]
{0935}	YOSHI: (Looks like I need a little[1] more practice. Oh, well...[1] let's try it again sometime.)[0]
{0936}	YOSHI: (Looks like I need a little[1] more practice. Oh, well...[1] let's try it again sometime.)[0]
{0937}	YOSHI: (Looks like I need a little[1] more practice. Oh, well...[1] let's try it again sometime.)[0]
{0938}	[4] (Here, take my Cookies.[1]  Good luck! I'm rooting for you!)[0]
{0939}	[4] (Yeah, maybe another day...[2]  So you've heard, right?...[2]  I'm just waiting for the day we[1]  can all race together.)[0]
{0940}	 (It's the best when we can[1]  all race together!)[0]
{0941}	[4] (Wait a sec...[1]  You don't have any Cookies...[3]  Well, since Yoshi got everyone to[1]  race again, I'll give you mine as[1]  a reward. Here, take 'em!)[0]
{0942}	[4] (Remember, you need Cookies[1] if you want to race!)[0]
{0943}	            Got [28][0] Cookie(s)![0]
{0944}	[4]YOSHI:[1]          I'll try my very best![0]
{0945}	[4] (Now no one has to be[1]  left out of a race!)[0]
{0946}	[4]BOSHI: (Let's race again[1] sometime, all right?)[0]
{0947}	[4][1]       One[6]
{0948}	[4][1]                Two[6]
{0949}	[4] (Okay, now. Line up beside me[1]   and we'll get this race going!)[0]
{0950}	 (You're carrying a lot of things![1]  I'll store these [28][0] for you.[1]  Don't worry...I won't eat them.[2]  That makes a total of [28][1]. )[0]
{0951}	 (That was mighty tasty.[1]  So now we're back to 200![2]  Thanks for the snack!)[0]
{0952}	 (That was mighty tasty.[1]  So now we're back to 200![2]  Thanks for the snack!)[0]
{0953}	 (You're carrying too many things[1]  and storing too many at the same[1]  time. It'd be a shame to waste[2]  them, so I'll grab a few to eat.)[0]
{0954}	[5][6]
{0955}	YOSHI: (Thanks! I've got[1] MAJOR support on my side, so[1] I can probably win today!)[0]
{0956}	[1]        Yoshi got some Cookies![0]
{0957}	              Got a “Map”![0]
{0958}	              Got a “Map”![0]
{0959}	 I almost forgot![3] This may not help you, but...[2] Why don't you take it along![0]
{0960}	MALLOW:[1]   What on earth ...WAS THAT?![0]
{0961}	GENO: Well, we won the battle.[1] Now I hope we don't lose the war.[1] Where are Dyna and the star?[0]
{0962}	GENO: I guess my question's just[1] been answered...[0]
{0963}	MALLOW: Come on Mario, let's GO![0]
{0964}	 Forgive me.[2] But I can't stop worrying[1] about the Princess...[0]

{1208}	[4] By the way, do you have any items[1] to get rid of?[3][6]
{1209}	 If you have extra items, we'll take[1] them for you.[3][6]
{1210}	 We ain't no store or nothing, so[1] you won't get any money for them,[1] but we'll give you points.[3] For every 100 points, you'll get[1] a gift.[3] Look at the sign to see the items[1] we offer.[3][6]

{1219}	      Received “[26]”[0]
{1220}	 Come on back when you get[1] spare items![0]
{1221}	 You're looking for a star?[1] Didn't you find one in the treasure[1] box, next to the trampoline?[0]
{1222}	 I have a star to sell, but you[1] don't have enough coins.[0]
{1223}	 You're looking for a star?[1] I'll sell one for 400 coins.[1] Are you interested?[2]  [7] (Yes)[1]  [7] (No)[0]

{1228}	 For 100 coins, this short cut will[1] get you back to the surface.[2]  [7] (Okay)[1]  [7] (No thanks)[0]
{1229}	 This trampoline will get you to the[1] surface. I'll let you use it for[1] 100 coins.[0]
{1230}	 Mmm, I'm so hungry![1] Wish I had something to eat![0]
{1231}	 Hmm, you look so tasty.[1] I think I'll just have a snack![0]
{1232}	 That bucket's my seat, so don't[1] take it, okay?[0]
{1233}	 That pipe is a shortcut to my home,[1] Monstro Town.[2] I'll see you there.[0]
{1234}	 Isn't this incredible?[2] It really does look like the edge of[1] the world, doesn't it?[3] It's too spooky for me![1] I'm heading back to Monstro Town.[2] See ya![0]
{1235}	 Give me the key, and I'll let you[1] pass through.[0]
{1236}	 That key you have there looks[1] pretty tasty.[2]  [7] (Give him the key)[1]  [7] (Keep the key)[0]
{1237}	 Eww, a mouthful of rust.[1] Thanks anyway.[0]
{1238}	 Sorry, I'm not accepting visitors[1] past my bedtime.[0]

{1240}	 Do you want your fortune told?[1] It'll cost 50 coins.[2]  [7] (Yes)[1]  [7] (No)[0]

{1242}	    Yikes, looks like you'll have[1]       hardships ahead of you.[0]
{1243}	 Looks like you'll have a great meal[1]        sometime in the future.[0]

{1250}	 Have you seen the huge hole in the[1] cliff at Booster Pass?[1] Strange, huh?[0]
{1251}	 Giving up?[1] Wanna give it another shot?[2]  [7] (Yes)[1]  [7] (No)[0]
{1252}	 Giving up?[1] Wanna give it another shot?[2]  [7] (Yes)[1]  [7] (No)[0]

{1274}	 Ok, listen up.[1] Look for the whirl where the ant[1] pops up and proceed after it.[3] Keep following it and you'll find[1] your way underground.[3] Once there, Monstro Town's just[1] around the corner.[1] I'll see you there.[0]
{1275}	 What did you do that for?[3] You won't get any coins from[1] jumping on me. It's Wiggler or[1] Shogun you ought to look for.[0]
{1276}	 I've been all around the world.[3] But the strangest person I met,[1] is this old geezer in Rose Town.[3] He really is weird, but definitely[1] worth meeting.[0]

{2055}	 Oh, honey![1] Please can we stay in the suite,[1] PLEASE?[0]
{2056}	 This place is known for its[1] exquisite service, especially in[2] the suite. But it's a tad pricey![0]
{2057}	 Isn't this just splendid?[1] This place is heaven even for the[1] rich and famous![0]

{2063}	SNIFIT 1: I'm not letting you[1] in here! And you can forget about[1] the back entrance. It's locked.[2] At least I THINK it is...[0]
{2064}	[1]         Halt! Who goes there?[0]
{2065}	SNIFIT 1: You LOOK like[1] Mario, but the door's shut tight.[2] Listen, Mustache, you and your[1] overgrown turtle-friend can take[1] a hike! Go! Scat![2] Make like Mario and jump[1] outta here! GET LOST![6]

{2069}	SNIFIT 2: Sorry, but I can't[1] let you through![0]
{2070}	SNIFIT 1&2: Booster, Sir![2] Mario's here![0]

{2073}	SNIFITS: We're pretty sure[1] Mr. Mustache can't break in here.[2] But that turtle looks pretty mean.[1] He could be trouble![0]
{2074}	BOWSER: They have no IDEA what[1] they're up against![0]
{2075}	[4] I'm lightning in a bottle![1] I'm an earthquake in a can![1] I'll bust this open in no time![0]
{2076}	BOWSER: You don't bring too much[1] to the party, but why don't you[1] help me here, anyway.[2] At least you'll feel like you did[1] SOMETHING![0]
{2077}	[4] Hya hya hya! Guess I'm one heck[1] of a party animal, huh?[3] Hya hya[12]...h[12][12]..[12]ya..[5][6]

{2085}	[4] What's this...?[2] Water...coming from your eyes?![2] Are you leaking, my dear?![0]
{2086}	[4][1]              Tastes salty![0]
{2087}	SNIFIT 2: Booster, Sir, uh...[1] I believe that the bride may be...[1] uh,...Crying...[0]
{2088}	BOOSTER: Crying?[1] But that's what people do when[1] they're...sad!![3] How DISGUSTING![1] That stuff must be corrosive![2] It tastes...like the sea![3] What could be making her...cry,[1] anyway?[0]
{2089}	SNIFIT 3: I believe she is crying[1] because she has dropped some of[1] her...wedding gear.[0]
{2090}	BOOSTER: Aha! Of course![2] She has dropped her gear.[3] But those tears will ruin[1] the cake! Make her stop...[2] ...before Mario breaks in![0]
{2091}	SNIFITS:[1]    But...Mario's ALREADY in...[0]
{2092}	SNIFIT 2: BOOSTER, Sir, hurry[1] and find her things! We have to[1] get on with the wedding![3] In the mean time, perhaps we can[1] ...do something about the cake...[0]
{2093}	BOOSTER: 10-4, good buddy.[3] You find her stuff...[1] I'll move the ceremony forward.[2] Hurry![0]
{2094}	            Hurry and get back[1]    the accessories from the Snifits[1]      and save Princess Toadstool![3]   If you're quick, something good[1]          just might happen![0]

{2104}	[4][1]       Finally...let's get back.[0]
{2105}	 Oh! I'm sooo exhausted![2] Heard there's a Casino where you[1] can get BIG BUCKS,[2] but I just can't find[1] the place. Does it really exist?[0]
{2106}	TOADSTOOL: SHRIEK!!![13][48][1] What is Bowser doing HERE?[0]
{2107}	[1]        I wish you a happy life.[0]
{2108}	[4] Well then, how about...[12][12][1] 5 Frog Coins! 5! That's major![2] [7]  (DEAL!)[1] [7]  (What else do you have?)[0]

{2112}	RAZ: This was supposed to be[1] my wedding day...[1] All my plans have been ruined...[0]
{2113}	RAINI: It was my dream to[1] stay in the SUITE[1] after we got married![0]
{2114}	 Who's the guy with a totem pole[1] for a face?! He and Princess[1] Toadstool were...[2] ...No...![12][12][12][1] Don't tell me...they're[12][12] getting[12][1] ....[12][12]MARRIED?[0]
{2115}	 Who's the nut case who[1] blew in screaming,[1] “It's time for MY wedding!”?[3][1]   Just who does he think HE IS?![0]
{2116}	 We were about to begin the[1] ceremony when some kids, wearing[1] dark clothes, kicked us out![0]
{2117}	 There! I think that's the one[1] who kicked us out![0]
{2118}	 I came all the way over here[1] to give these two a proper send[1] off, and LOOK what happens![0]
{2119}	 This must be a first![2] A perfect couple who isn't going[1] to live happily ever after...[2] I give up![0]
{2120}	[1]                 Hmmmm....[12][12][12][0]
{2121}	[1]       Looks like he needs to go[1]           somewhere...fast![0]
{2122}	SNIFIT 1: Booster's[1] wedding is in progress.[3] We've barricaded the door, so[1] don't even bother trying to[1] sneak inside.[0]
{2123}	BOOSTER: Oh oh...I have a BAD[1] feeling my wedding is going[1] to be crashed.[0]
{2124}	SNIFIT 2: Booster, Sir, you're[1] supposed to be on the right.[2] The bride should be on your left.[0]
{2125}	BOOSTER: Just testing...[6]
{2126}	  [1] Like this, right?[0]
{2127}	BOOSTER: Me too![1] I want a reward![3][1] I'll take a kiss! Give me a KISS!!![0]
{2128}	TOADSTOOL: I know I'm in good[1] hands when you're around, Mario![3][1]      Here's a kiss for my hero![0]
{2129}	BOWSER: Oh, isn't that great![0]
{2130}	[1] You're gonna kiss HIM when[1] I'm the one who saved your skin![0]
{2131}	BOWSER: What a waste of time![1] I've got bigger fish to fry...![0]
{2132}	TOADSTOOL: Stop it, all of you![1] I'm getting SO confused![0]

{2187}	[1] We're going back now, right?![2] [7]  (Okay)[1] [7]  (No)[0]
{2188}	MALLOW: Mario![0]
{2189}	[4] The Chancellor must be worried[1] sick about us. You saw him before![6]
{2190}	[1] C'mon, let's GO.[2] [7]  (Okay)[1] [7]  (NO!)[0]
{2191}	GENO: Mario![0]
{2192}	[4] If we don't get the Princess[1] back, WE'LL be charged with[1] kidnapping! Let's go![2] [7]  (Oh, all right)[1] [7]  (NO!)[0]
{2193}	 We're finally “man and wife”.[0]
{2194}	 Honey, I don't want you to[1] wander too far off, now![0]

{2198}	[1]      I wish it were ski season![0]
{2199}	 I wish those two a wonderful[1] life together.[2] Hope they don't fight too often![0]
{2200}	 Oh man, is it over, yet?[2] I hate getting my picture taken.[0]
{2201}	SNIFIT 1: Ready?[1] Here we go!...[5][0]
{2202}	 All right,[2] on the count of 3, say[1] “Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!”[0]
{2203}	BOWSER: (Can't...[12][12]tell 'em...[1] the truth...If this gets out...[2] I'm finished...!)[0]
{2204}	CHANCELLOR: Y,[12] yes...[12][12]I see.[0]
{2205}	MALLOW: Wrong way, Mario![1] She went through THAT door![0]
{2206}	TOADSTOOL: Bowser...[1] Perhaps it's time you[1] told us your story![3] What, exactly, did you mean[1] when you said you had,[1] “Bigger fish to fry?”[0]
{2207}	MALLOW: Excuse me, Sir...[1] Perhaps I can set the stage, and[2] the others can add their comments[1] along the way![0]
{2208}	 The Princess, Bowser and Mario[2] were thrown in different directions[1] after a terrible explosion...[0]
{2209}	[4] Something HUGE crashed through[1] the Star Road high above[1] Bowser's place...[12]and[12]...[0]
{2210}	[4] And went....[0]
{2211}	[4][1]                KABOOM![3]  [1]     Right into Bowser's Keep!![0]
{2212}	 It was a gigantic sword![3] Now Bowser's Keep has been[1] taken over by monsters who work[1] for some creep named “Smithy.”[0]
{2213}	BOWSER: They've thrown me out[1] of my own...[13][48] I mean...[2] I decided to take a vacation![5][6]
{2214}	[1] ...Mario walked up to me and[1] BEGGED me to let him join the[1] Koopa Troop! I had no choice[2] but to let him in. It was pathetic.[0]
{2215}	MALLOW: Hello~, is anybody home?[1] I just said she went through[1] THAT door, over there![0]
{2216}	TOADSTOOL: Chancellor![5][6]
{2217}	[1] Listen, everyone, RELAX![1] Mario's got things under control![0]
{2218}	[1] Anyway, I was working on a plan[1] to get my house back, when...[0]
{2219}	      [1] They CAN'T do this to me![5][6]
{2220}	TOADSTOOL: It's okay, Mario.[1] We know Bowser's stretching[1] the truth a little![0]
{2221}	[4] And...um, Geno,... was it?[1] Why are you and Mario...[0]
{2222}	[4] And...Mallow...how about you?[1] Why are you traveling with Mario?[0]
{2223}	MALLOW: Well, because Mario's[1] helping me find my real home...[1] And my parents...[3] That's why we're[1] on the road together.[0]
{2224}	 Welcome back, Mario![1] All's well here![0]
{2225}	 Mario, where have you been?[1] I've never been so worried! I'm[1] so angry I can't see straight![2] Would you want to marry someone[1] who can't see straight?![0]
{2226}	 Lately, the Princess hasn't been[1] around to look at the flowers.[0]
{2227}	 Wow! That sure woke me up![0]
{2228}	TOADSTOOL: Shhhh....[2] If people see who I'm with, they'll[1] flip out, so...[2] Let's be real quiet![0]
{2229}	 I just love the smell of flowers![3][12][12] I'm sorry...I'm in a rush right[1] now. I'll come back another time.[0]
{2230}	 Mario, welcome home![1] Please, go in.[0]
{2231}	 Oooh! It's good to see you back.[1] Look what I found in the wallet[1] you returned to me.[3] It's yours, isn't it?[0]
{2232}	 Were you able to rescue the[1] Princess from Bowser,[2] that good for noth...[0]
{2233}	[4] Eh?[1] W...what was that...odd noise?[0]
{2234}	 Say hey! Welcome back.[1] The Chancellor's been worrying[2] about you ever since you left.[1] Come see me later![0]
{2235}	 Avoid fighting the pointy monsters[1] up on Star Hill.[0]
{2236}	 Hey Mario! Wanna grab something[1] to eat?[0]
{2237}	[1]    Go on now, don't hang back![0]
{2238}	 Mario, go see my brother[1] jump. He's been practicing[1] like crazy![0]
{2239}	 Boing, boing, boing...[2] Hey, Mario![1] I can out jump YOU now![2] [7]  (Impressive!)[1] [7]  (Keep practicing, kid)[0]
{2240}	[4][1]               ALL RIGHT![0]
{2241}	 Hello Mario! Oh, hi, Mallow,[1] didn't see you there![1] Well, what can I get you two?[0]
{2242}	 Enough with the chatter...[2] On your way, now.[0]
{2243}	            Got a Frog Coin![0]
{2244}	TOAD: Mario!...[1] Welcome back!![1] You look like you're in one piece![0]
{2245}	[1]           P..[12][12].P..[12]Princess![0]
{2246}	TOADSTOOL: I'm finally home![2] And with Mario...[0]
{2247}	[1] and some wonderful...[1] new friends! They saved my life.[0]
{2248}	TOAD:[1]    Let's go find the Chancellor...[0]
{2249}	TOADSTOOL:[1]                 Lead on![0]
{2250}	[4] Come on Mario. We mustn't[1] keep the Chancellor waiting![0]
{2251}	 Mario! Welcome home.[2] The place is looking sharp,[1] is it not?[0]
{2252}	TOAD: Chancellor![2] The...the Princess...[1] She's BACK!![0]
{2253}	CHANCELLOR: Thank goodness![2] This has been a true nightmare![5][6]
{2254}	 I'm a nervous wreck![0]
{2255}	TOADSTOOL: I know I've worried[1] everyone...[5][6]
{2256}	[4] But I'm fine![1] I can take care of myself...[2] ...With a little help from Mario![0]
{2257}	CHANCELLOR: Come, everyone![2] Let's get out of this[1] drafty doorway![0]
{2258}	TOADSTOOL: Mario, I hope you[1] know how thankful we are![0]
{2259}	 But...[12][12]you MUST tell[1] me one thing! How on earth[2] can you trust...[12][12]Bowser?[0]
{2260}	CHANCELLOR: Trust...Bowser?[1] What ARE you talking about?![0]
{2261}	CHANCELLOR: Mario![1] What are YOU doing with...[0]
{2262}	[1]       WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?[0]
{2263}	[1]                 EGADS![0]
{2264}	GENO: The Star Road has been[1] destroyed. I'm here to fix it.[3] Mario is helping me search for[1] the Star Pieces. I need them to[1] rebuild the road...[0]
{2265}	TOADSTOOL: Star...Pieces?[0]
{2266}	MALLOW: The Star Road grants[1] our wishes![3] Unless we find all the Star Pieces[1] and fix the Star Road, we can[1] kiss our dreams goodbye![0]
{2267}	TOADSTOOL: WHAT?![1] This is dreadful news![1] Awful! Horrible...![5][6]
{2268}	GENO: Indeed...for example...[2] Say Bowser kidnapped you.[1] Without the aid of the Star Road,[1] you'd probably never be rescued![0]
{2269}	BOWSER: Actually, that sounds[1] pretty GOOD to me![1] Let's just forget about these...[2] Star...things![0]
{2270}	TOADSTOOL: Great, Bowser. Then[1] you can just kiss your precious[1] “Keep” goodbye![0]
{2271}	TOADSTOOL: Urgh!!![1] Just ignore that idiot![5][6]
{2272}	[1] I just don't think I could take[1] a world without wishes...[5][6]
{2273}	[4] We need to go and find[1] those Star Pieces, NOW![0]
{2274}	TOADSTOOL: I don't care! Things[1] seem so hopeless right now...[0]
{2275}	 I'm tired...[2] I think I need to lie down[1] in my room for awhile.[0]
{2276}	TOADSTOOL: Mario...Mallow...[1] Geno and...Bowser, you too...[2] Good luck![0]
{2277}	[1]                 Isn't it?[0]
{2278}	 BOWSER:[1]             HUH?! WHAT?![0]
{2279}	[4] Huh?[12][12] Let's see. If Mario[2] can't find the stars...[13][48][6]
{2280}	[1] Toadstool will be MINE![13][32][6]
{2281}	[1] But I won't get my Keep back...[13][32][6]
{2282}	[1] unless Mario finds the stars![13][32][6]
{2283}	[1] So if I want my Keep back...[6]
{2284}	[1] we need those star things, but...[5][6]
{2285}	[1] Huh?! Run that past me again![0]
{2286}	CHANCELLOR: Princess![5][6]
{2287}	 You CAN'T be serious![1] You're NOT thinking of[1] joining them, ARE YOU?[5][6]
{2288}	 This is sheer madness...[1] You're a Princess![2] What will people say?![0]
{2289}	MALLOW: You must not care[1] about my parents...[1] You're so mean, Mario.[0]
{2290}	 I hope you find your[1] real parents soon![0]
{2291}	CHANCELLOR: Now then![0]
{2292}	 Thanks to Mario,[1] the Princess is back.[1] I now declare this date to be[2] known forever as,...[0]
{2293}	 ...Hey, wait a minute![1] You don't suppose...[0]
{2294}	 Could it have been this “Smithy”[1] who attacked our Kingdom?[3] I fear we have no cause to[1] rejoice. In fact, Mario, we must[1] ask you for yet another favor...[0]
{2295}	 Please...on behalf of all of us,[1] you MUST defeat Smithy...[3] It is the only way we shall ever[1] live in peace again.[0]
{2296}	BOWSER: Grumph![0]
{2297}	 You do as you're told, and[1] everything will be just...peachy.[0]
{2298}	TOAD:[1]         Happy hunting, Mario![0]
{2299}	[1]           Thank you, Mario![0]
{2300}	[1]          Excellent job, Mario![0]
{2301}	      Princess Toadstool is home[1]          safe, but she has...[2]   decided to stay at the Kingdom![0]
{2302}	       “Toadstool”, Princess of[1]           Mushroom Kingdom,[1]          has joined the party.[2]   Be sure to bring her back safely![0]
{2303}	           Just as I thought![13][48][1]      Toadstool joins the party[1]               once AGAIN![0]
{2304}	 Don't worry, Princess. A little[1] adventure will do you good![1] See the world! Make friends![3] Help destroy Smithy...[0]
{2305}	 Oh dear![12][1] The Princess went out looking[1] for you. Please find her![0]
{2306}	[1]                  Mario![13][64][6]
{2307}	[4] You're KILLIN' me here![1] All rightee then, how about 10?[1] That's TEN Frog Coins![2]  [7]  (It's a deal!)[1]  [7]  (Nope)[0]
{2308}	[4] Ho ho!...Mr. Wise guy doesn't[1] think 10 Frog Coins is enough![2] You don't know what you're[1] missing, but...OH, WELL...[0]
{2309}	[1]         Wait! Don't leave me![0]
{2310}	[1]          At times like these....[0]
{2311}	TOADSTOOL: [1]          What should we do?[0]
{2312}	MALLOW: We should ask Grandpa![1] My Grandpa should know![0]
{2313}	TOADSTOOL: Okay then![2] Let's do it![0]
{2314}	TOADSTOOL: Please, Mario![2] Take me along with you, please![0]
{2315}	 Don't worry.[2] Grandma helped me through[1] this one, so no one will ever[1] notice that I'm gone![0]
{2316}	 So...let's go find us a star![5][6]
{2317}	[1] [12]Hmmm[12]...[12][2] But I wonder where it could be...[1] I have absolutely no idea! Do you?[0]
{2318}	 I'll make sure that Princess[1] Toadstool will be able to lead a[1] safe, and long, life![2] You can bet on it![0]
{2319}	 I'll make sure that Princess[1] Toadstool will be able to lead a[1] safe, and long, life![2] You can bet on it![0]
{2320}	[1]     The Princess is resting now.[0]
{2321}	[1]                  Mario![0]
{2322}	TOADSTOOL: Stop peeking into[1] other people's rooms![0]
{2323}	 Princess![0]
{2324}	TOADSTOOL: Hello Grandma,[1] I'm back. I hope I didn't worry[1] you too much...[0]
{2325}	 Nonsense, dear.[2] By the way, have you seen[1] the Chancellor yet?[0]
{2326}	TOADSTOOL: I was just on my way.[2] See you later![0]
{2327}	 Run along and talk to the[1] Chancellor right away.[1] We'll talk later, dear.[0]
{2328}	 Our wishes have come true,[1] so we will be having our[1] wedding in Marrymore![2] We'll be gone for a while![1]                         Raz & Raini[0]
{2329}	 What's that?[1] You want your card back?[12][1] Okay, well...it's 15 Frog Coins.[2] [7]  (Here you go)[1] [7]  (Forget it)[0]
{2330}	 Please leave the correct amount[1] of money for the items.[1]                             Manager[0]

{2358}	[4] (This time, the odds on Yoshi[1]  are [28][0].5 : 1 Well?)[2]  [7]  (I'll race Yoshi)[1]  [7]  (I'll hop off and watch Yoshi)[0]
{2359}	[4] (So how many Cookies[1]  are you gonna wager?[2]  You can wager up to 10.)[0]
{2360}	[4][1]         (Nice weather, eh?)[0]

{2377}	RAZ: Oh, you have the card![2] Looks like you can use it to play[1] games at a place near Bean Valley.[1] Who knows?![3] Maybe I'll see you there, huh?[1] It might be fun![0]

{2382}	 Looks like we've been scolded.[0]
{2383}	BOSHI:[1]    (Line it up, ON THE DOUBLE!)[0]
{2384}	[1]   All right, everyone! Listen up![0]
{2385}	VALENTINA:[1]                SHUDDAP!!![0]
{2386}	VALENTINA: King Nimbus' condition[1] is growing worse...[1] This means we'll be losing...[2] ...our magnificent ruler...[0]
{2387}	VALENTINA: BUT![3] It just so happens that[1] I have found the missing Prince![1] Prince Mallow, that is![0]
{2388}	VALENTINA: Prince Mallow...[1][12] Please...Sir...[12]Prince?[0]
{2389}	[1]        ...[12]GET OVER HERE!![0]
{2390}	VALENTINA: Well, well...[1] It seems that our little prince has[1] a mild case of stage fright.[2] Excuse me...[12][12][12]Ha ha ha...[12][0]
{2391}	[1]     (Come ON! Make it snappy!)[0]
{2392}	 (What?! You can't get through?[2]  Well, just LOOK at you, tubby!)[0]
{2393}	[1]    Welcome back! Prince Mallow![0]
{2394}	 My, you've...er...filled out a bit,[1] Prince Mallow![0]
{2395}	[1]      You're looking fit, Prince![0]
{2396}	VALENTINA: Yes...?[1] What is it, dear?...[0]
{2397}	[1]  WHAT?! You're asking ME to...?[0]
{2398}	 Gracious![2] You're serious, aren't you?[1] Why, I don't know what to say![0]
{2399}	VALENTINA:[1]           Dear me...[12]...[12]...[12]...[13][48][6]
{2400}	 I've made my decision...[2] At the request of the Prince,[1] I agree to become his queen.[0]
{2401}	 (Queen[12][12]... Valentina...[12]Ooh![1]  It just makes me SHIVER!!)[0]
{2402}	VALENTINA: Well, that's that![1] Back to your business, everyone![0]
{2403}	[1]       (Hurry it up, will ya?!)[0]
{2404}	MALLOW: Can you believe it?![2] What a coincidence! There's a[1] prince with the same name as ME![0]
{2405}	 Don't we have anything[1] better to do than hang around[1] HERE? Come on, let's go and[2] find the rest of the Star Pieces!![0]
{2406}	VALENTINA: Introducing...[1] ...Prince Mallow![0]
{2407}	 Say, you have that, “I'm looking[1] for something” look in your eyes.[2] What can I do for you?[0]
{2408}	 You think you're sooo hot,[1] but...you're not![0]
{2409}	 I used to work for King Nimbus,[1] but all of a sudden one day,[3] Valentina told me I was fired![1] I just don't get it...[1] He NEEDS help. He's sick...![0]
{2410}	 I used to work in the castle.[1] You should see the way she hits[1] poor Dodo![3] What a horrible life he must live![0]
{2411}	 That's Garro the sculptor's place.[1] He used to make all kinds of[1] things for King Nimbus![3] But these days, he has nothing but[1] time on his hands, what with the[1] King being sick and all...[0]
{2412}	 Been a while since I saw Prince[1] Mallow...He's...changed, but[1] yes, I do believe that's him.[0]
{2413}	 Was Prince Mallow that HEAVY?![2] Well, she says it's him,[1] so it must be him![0]
{2414}	 Poor King Nimbus appears to be[1] a tad under the weather![0]
{2415}	 I wonder why more people from the[1] world down under don't visit us[1] these days?[2] I hope it's nothing personal...[0]
{2416}	 Why did Prince Mallow make[1] Valentina his queen?...I guess[2] it's because she found him.[0]
{2417}	 You like the guards we have at the[1] entrance now? I don't. Never used[1] to have 'em...[0]
{2418}	 I wish the King would get well![1] But at least the Prince is back[1] just in case something...awful[2] happens.[0]
{2419}	 Hey! Who're YOU?!...[2] You can't just barge in here![0]
{2420}	MALLOW:[1]          Hey look! It's ME![0]
{2421}	GARRO: Oh, you mean THAT?[1] That's King Nimbus when he was...[1] [12][12]a[12][12] ...young lad.[13][48][5][6]
{2422}	[4] ...What the...?![13][48]...[1] WHO are YOU...?![0]
{2423}	GARRO: Mallow...[12][12][1] So it IS YOU, my boy![1] It's been so long. My, you've[2] become a splendid young prince![0]
{2424}	MALLOW: WHAT?![1] I'm...I'm really a...prince?![0]
{2425}	GARRO: I KNEW Valentina[1] was up to SOMETHING![1] I just didn't know what...[3] That must mean that the King[1] really ISN'T gravely ill...![0]
{2426}	MALLOW: Then let's go inside[1] the castle and save my[1] mother and father![0]
{2427}	GARRO: ...[12][12]Wait![1] I have an excellent idea.[2] Come over here...[0]
{2428}	GARRO:[1]                 THERE![0]
{2429}	[1]           Hey, don't move![0]
{2430}	You're going to be a “statue” for[1]a while, okay?[0]
{2431}	[1]          Let's get going now.[0]
{2432}	[4][1]             ...[12]![12]...[12]! Huh?[12][12][13][48][6]
{2433}	MALLOW: Hello.[1] My name is Mallow.[5][6]
{2434}	[1] And this is my friend, Mario.[0]
{2435}	GARRO: Yes indeed! I understand.[2] So! You were raised by Frogfucius![5][6]
{2436}	[1] There's no question about it![1] You ARE, WITHOUT A DOUBT...[1] Prince Mallow.[0]
{2437}	MALLOW: Mario! Look at me![1] I'm a prince![0]
{2438}	[4] Just stay still for a little[1] while, okay? It won't take long.[0]
{2439}	GARRO: Are you ready?[2] [7]  (Yes)[1] [7]  (No, not yet. Hang on)[0]
{2440}	[4][1]          Okay, just say when.[0]
{2441}	GARRO:[4][1]      All right, stand over here.[0]
{2442}	[4][1]      All right, stand over here.[0]
{2443}	[1]            Hold still, okay?[0]
{2444}	 Hi. I'm the sculptor, Garro.[1] I used to make a lot of statues[1] of King Nimbus, but now,[3] all I get are orders for[1] sculptures of Valentina.[0]
{2445}	 GARRO: I'm delivering Valentina's[1]  latest order to her.[0]
{2446}	[1]              You may enter.[0]
{2447}	 Hey, this doesn't look like[1] Valentina at all![0]
{2448}	GARRO: Oh?! That's because[3] this is a statue of Valentina's[1] nephew, Mari..Mariotta![1] Okay?![0]
{2449}	[1]         Uh...[12][12]okay.[12][12] Proceed.[0]
{2450}	GARRO: Phew, that was close...[1] Didn't think we could get through[1] THAT ONE. There IS no such[2] person named Mariotta. Ha![0]
{2451}	VALENTINA: Oh! Now THIS is[1] lovely! My beauty simply shines[1] forth like the sun! Only YOU can[2] make something THIS stunning![0]
{2452}	GARRO: Thank you, your majesty.[2] I'll be on my way now...[0]
{2453}	VALENTINA:[1]                  Halt![0]
{2454}	[1] What, may I ask is THIS ugly thing?[0]
{2455}	GARRO: OH! You mean[12]...[1] THAT...[12][12]That's ...um...[0]
{2456}	 That's my latest masterpiece.[1] I...I created it just for[1] YOU...[5] It's called...[12][12][3] [1]        “A Plumber's Lament”[0]
{2457}	 Observe...the thick mustache...[1] covering the sad, innocent smile[2] of a simple fool...[0]
{2458}	 And the sideburns...[1] conveying his blue collar roots.[0]
{2459}	 And the legs...well defined...[2] Strong. The legs of the masses![2] Is it to your liking?[0]
{2460}	VALENTINA: Hmmm...[2] I consider myself something of an[1] art buff! And I've got to say...[12][12][1] This is spectacular!![0]
{2461}	 Garro...only YOU could have[2] created sculptures with such[1] gentle beauty and...raw power![0]
{2462}	 DODO!...DODO!!...[2] Don't just sit there like a roast![1] Hurry and carry these in![0]
{2463}	[1]           ...[12]...[12]...DODO!![0]
{2464}	[1]               Step on it![0]
{2465}	[1]             O, ho, ho, ho!![0]
{2466}	 VALENTINA: ...[2]  ...[12][12]SPECTACULAR!![0]
{2467}	 Prince Mallow, as I remember him,[1] used to be so small, so timid...[2] Now, just LOOK at him![0]
{2468}	   (Oops[12][12]...[12][12]I've lost my dentures)[5][6]

{2654}	 Welcome to The Juice Bar![3] Are you a card member?[2] Even Toadofsky has a membership[1] here![0]
{2655}	 May I help you?[0]
{2656}	 Sorry, you're limited to this menu[1] if you don't have a current[1] membership card.[0]
{2657}	 Ah! An “Alto Card” holder![2] What would you like?[0]
{2658}	 Hmm.[1] A “Tenor Card” holder, huh?[2] What'll it be?[0]
{2659}	 Wow, a “Soprano Card” holder![2] What can I get you?[0]
{2660}	 Can't wait to graduate from music[1] school and start composing![0]
{2661}	 I haven't had one made yet.[0]
{2662}	 I've got this dream...[2] of becoming a composer...[3] I want to be as famous as[1] Toadofsky![0]
{2663}	 My favorite song?[0]
{2664}	 It's Frogfucius' suite #18.[1] [37]“So La Mi Re Do Re Do Re”.[1] Toadofsky's fond of it, too![0]
{2665}	 It's the Moleville miners' song,[1] [37]“Mi Do So Do Re La Ti Do”.[1] It's got soul![0]
{2666}	 You're a first timer, aren't you?[2] Listen up. The green coins you find[1] periodically are Frog Coins.[3] Accumulate them and you can buy[1] items at Tadpole Pond.[0]
{2667}	 Hi![1] Welcome to Tadpole Pond.[2] Who are you?[0]
{2668}	 It's the song that the Monstro[1] Town star dances to.[0]
{2669}	 Mallow, it's you![3] We've heard all about your[1] adventures with Super Mario.[2] You guys beat up Belome, right?[0]
{2670}	MALLOW: You know about that?[3] See Mario, the waterways of[1] the world bring news to us here.[3] That's why Grandpa knows[1] all the news that's fit to hear![0]
{2671}	 Are you really THE Super Mario?[3] Hey everybody![1] You'll never guess who's here![0]
{2672}	 Sorry, Tadpole Pond items are all[1] sold out![3] Thanks for coming by.[0]
{2673}	 Oops, I forgot the rest.[0]
{2674}	 I heard your composition, and it's[1] pretty good.[0]
{2675}	 Hi![1] Can I help you?[0]
{2676}	 He's the real thing![1] But he doesn't look anything like[1] I thought he would...[0]
{2677}	 He's the real thing![1] But he doesn't look anything like[1] I thought he would...[0]
{2678}	 He's the real thing![1] But he doesn't look anything like[1] I thought he would...[0]
{2679}	 He's the real thing![1] But he doesn't look anything like[1] I thought he would...[0]
{2680}	 They DO say he can jump better[1] than a froggie.[1] I wonder if it's only a rumor?[0]
{2681}	FROGFUCIUS: Well, grasshopper...[1] What's new?[0]
{2682}	MALLOW: Grandpa![1] Mario's been helping me![0]
{2683}	FROGFUCIUS: Welcome![5][1] So you are Mario, yes?[1] I am Frogfucius.[3] You have come to seek wisdom[1] from me, have you not?[1] I've been waiting for you![3] Yes, “Old Wise People” can often[1] give good advice...[0]
{2684}	FROGFUCIUS: I know, child.[2] That rainstorm we just had...[1] that was YOU wasn't it?[0]
{2685}	FROGFUCIUS: But how rude of me![1] Let's get more comfortable.[1] Come along and we'll talk.[3][1]        (Clear! Full reverse!)[0]
{2686}	 Tadpoles! Don't just FLOAT there![1] Make yourselves useful![5][1] Form a bridge for Mario.[0]
{2687}	[1]                (Ouch!)[3][1]        (Watch it, up there!)[3](You're SUPPOSED to make me look[1]  like I'm FLOATING here, okay?!)[0]
{2688}	FROGFUCIUS: Yes, come into my[1] sanctuary and partake of my[1] wisdom, children.[0]
{2689}	FROGFUCIUS: Yes, come into my[1] sanctuary and partake of my[1] wisdom, children.[0]
{2690}	FROGFUCIUS: Let's see...[3] That Smithy character that[1] appeared at Bowser's Keep...[1] He is quite formidable, yes?[3] And, Mario, you wish to rescue[1] the princess quickly, do you not?[3] But, oh![1] If only you knew the truth![5][1] Toadstool is no longer there![0]
{2691}	 Patience, young one.[2] Let me explain.[1] Here is what happened...[0]
{2692}	 Whoosh, out of the blue![3] The shock sent the three of you[1] flying.[3] Bowser and Toadstool are still[1] lost, somewhere out there.[2] Now...[0]
{2693}	 You're worried about the princess,[1] but first you need to take care[1] of Smithy.[3] His underlings are wreaking havoc[1] in our world![3] “Mack”, whom you defeated at[1] Mushroom Kingdom, was one of[1] them. More will be coming.[0]
{2694}	MALLOW: Grandpa, I almost forgot[1] to tell ya something![2] We found a star in the castle at[1] Mushroom Kingdom.[1] Do you know why it was there?[0]
{2695}	FROGFUCIUS: A star, eh...[1] ...most interesting.[3] This may sound illogical, but I[1] believe shooting stars can[1] grant wishes...[3] And now more than ever, I believe[1] they will play a vital role in[1] the fight against Smithy.[0]
{2696}	MALLOW: Wow, everything sounds[1] so dire and serious.[3] I guess Mack was only the first[1] of many, Mario. Some of them'll[1] make Bowser seem NICE.[0]
{2697}	 You were rescuing Toadstool from[1] Bowser's Keep.[3] After defeating him, and JUST[1] when you were about to free the[1] princess...[3] You heard a loud “crash”, and[1] saw a huge sword split the sky![0]
{2698}	FROGFUCIUS: Mallow, you speak as[1] if these things do not concern you.[3] You will accompany Mario on his[1] adventure, too.[0]
{2699}	MALLOW: Grandpa![1] What are you talking about?[3] I'm only a simple tadpole![1] This adventure isn't for me![0]
{2700}	FROGFUCIUS: Mallow, my boy,[1] I've kept this from you until now,[5][1] but you're...[3][1]           [12][12][12][12] Not a tadpole!!![0]
{2701}	 I was sitting here one rainy day,[1] enjoying a snack of crickets...[3] When I happened to see a basket[1] floating down from the falls.[3] I peeked inside, and saw a little[1] baby staring right back at me![1] The name “Mallow” was written[3] on his belt. I felt sorry for the[1] little bundle of puff and took him[1] in to raise as my own grandchild.[3] He had powerful magic, and I knew[1] he was more than a piece of fluff.[3] I thought,“Surely, this child must[1] be from some far off land.”[0]
{2702}	MALLOW: Grandpa...[1] You mean, I'm not...a tadpole?[3][12][12]Sniffle...[1]               [12][12]sniffle...[1]                             [12][12]sniffle...[0]
{2703}	FROGFUCIUS: Mallow![2] Now is not the time to cry![3] Go with Mario on his adventure[1] and find your real family.[3] Your real mother and father are[1] out there, somewhere.[0]
{2704}	FROGFUCIUS: (Psst, Mario)[0]
{2705}	 The boy's magic is sure to come in[1] handy on your adventure.[1] You'll take him along, yes?[0]
{2706}	MALLOW: Grandpa![3] I won't cry anymore.[1] I'll go on this adventure with[1] Mario and find my real family![0]
{2707}	[1]            Say WHAT???[1][0]
{2708}	FROGFUCIUS: Then it is settled.[1] You must embark on your adventure[1] immediately.[3] First, go to “Rose Town” where[1] they need your help.[0]
{2709}	 That's right![1] I had forgotten all about it.[3] I will give you something for the[1] Cricket Pie you brought back.[3] [12][43][12][43][12]Ah, I know![1] You shall have the staff I used[1] when I was Mallow's age.[0]
{2710}	FROGFUCIUS:[1] Go to “Rose Town” now, Mallow.[1] Luck be with you![0]
{2711}	FROGFUCIUS: The “Froggie Stick”[1] will come in handy.[2] Do not forget to equip it.[0]
{2712}	FROGFUCIUS: Grasshopper, do you[1] not think it rude to stand on my[1] dining table?[0]
{2713}	 Welcome to the “Frog Coin”[1] emporium![0]
{2714}	TOADOFSKY: Hmmm.[1] Was that your song I just heard?[0]
{2715}	 It won't do at all![1] It is not the masterpiece I am[1] trying to compose![0]
{2716}	 It won't do at all![1] It is not the masterpiece I am[1] trying to compose![0]
{2717}	 You're on your way to composing![0]
{2718}	[1]       So La Mi Re Do Re Do Re [0]
{2719}	TOADOFSKY: You want a music[1] lesson from MOI?[2]  [7] (Yes)[1]  [7] (Nope)[0]
{2720}	 Let's start by reading “notes”.[1] See the five lines?[3] Between the second and third lines[1] from the top, lies “Do”.[3] Keep going up, and the notes are[1] “Do Re Mi”. Go down and you'll[1] get “Do Ti La So Fa”.[0]
{2721}	 Well, be that way![0]
{2722}	              Play notes by[1]       jumping on the tadpoles.[2]        Let's hear your melody.[0]
{2723}	FROGFUCIUS: (Snif) It will be quiet[1] around here with Mallow gone.[2] Maybe a snack will cheer me up.[0]
{2724}	TOADOFSKY:[1] Is that something you composed?[0]
{2725}	 It's not what I'm looking for.[1] It won't do at all.[0]
{2726}	 No, that's not the right melody.[0]
{2727}	 That sort of resembles the melody[1] I'm thinking of.[0]
{2728}	 That's remarkably similar to what[1] I have in mind.[0]
{2729}	 Now that is amazingly close to my[1] dream composition![0]
{2730}	TOADOFSKY: That's it!![3] This is the melody I've been[1] looking for.[1] Thank you for the inspiration![0]
{2731}	 Please take this as a token of my[1] gratitude.[0]
{2732}	 I am the composer, Toadofsky.[3] I am trying to create my next[1] masterpiece but I've got[1] composer's block.[0]
{2733}	  They won't play with strangers,[1] so go and meet Frogfucius first.[0]
{2734}	TOADOFSKY: If I ever need help with[1] my compositions again, I'll look[1] for you here.[2] Until then, adieu![0]
{2735}	FROGFUCIUS: Looks like your help[1] is needed in “Moleville”.[1] Go and see what you can do.[0]
{2736}	      Received a “Honey Syrup”[0]
{2737}	       Received a “Flower Tab”[0]
{2738}	          Found “Zoom Shoes”[0]
{2739}	         Received an “Amulet”[0]
{2740}	FROGFUCIUS: I have been thinking.[1] Is it possible that the bride at[1] Booster's Tower is the princess?[0]
{2741}	       Received an “Alto Card”[0]
{2742}	       Received an “Alto Card”[0]
{2743}	TOAD: Phew, my life was flashing[1] before my eyes for a second there.[2] Here's a little something in return.[0]
{2744}	TOAD: Phew, my life was flashing[1] before my eyes for a second there.[2] Here's a little something in return.[0]
{2745}	TOAD: Phew, my life was flashing[1] before my eyes for a second there.[2] Here's a little something in return.[0]
{2746}	TOAD: Phew, my life was flashing[1] before my eyes for a second there.[2] Here's a little something in return.[0]
{2747}	TOAD: Boy that was a close call.[2] Here's a token of my appreciation.[0]
{2748}	TOAD: Thanks for saving me![1] In my rush to tell the Chancellor,[1] I didn't watch where I was going.[2] Mushroom Kingdom's just ahead,[1] Mario. Let's hurry there.[0]
{2749}	              Get an item![0]
{2750}	 Ahem, then please allow me.[2] In order to use items, open up[1] the “Menu” screen.[2] With it, you can check your status[1] and coin count.[3] Push “X” to open it.[6]
{2751}	      Received a “Tenor Card”[0]
{2752}	       Received a “Mushroom”![0]
{2753}	    Received three “Mushrooms”![0]
{2754}	             Got a “Chomp”[0]
{2755}	     Received a “Soprano Card”[0]
{2756}	TOAD: Mario![1] You're forgetting something.[1] Come with me and I'll show you.[0]
{2757}	TOAD: Mario![1] You're forgetting something.[1] Come with me and I'll show you.[0]
{2758}	TOAD: Before you start off, it's[1] best to jump up on these boxes[1] and “Save” as often as possible.[3] In case of an emergency, you can[1] always start over from the last[1] place you saved.[0]
{2759}	TOAD: Hey Mario![2] Lots of people use something[1] called a “door” to go in and out[1] of their houses...[3] Anyway, I came by to pick up[1] Toadstool, since she's a bit late.[0]
{2760}	TOAD: Hey I thought the princess[1] was here with you, Mario![1] So where is she?[0]
{2761}	 Mario, what's with the silent[1] treatment?![2] You're not telling me something.[3] [12][12]It's Bowser again, isn't it?[2] Oh no, here we go again![3] Mario, would you please bring her[1] back, like you always do?[0]
{2762}	TOAD: If you're tired, just turn off[1] the “Fungi Light” for a snooze.[0]
{2763}	TOAD: You're back so soon![1] Did you forget something?[3] No?[12][12] What happened then?[0]
{2764}	TOAD: The bridge to Bowser's Keep[1] is out now?[2] Just wonderful...[3] We must inform the Chancellor of[1] Mushroom Kingdom at once![1] Let's go, Mario.[0]
{2765}	TOAD: Oops, excuse me![3] [43][12]Oh?[5][1] That bump on your head reduced[1] your “HP” level.[3] One of Mushroom Kingdom's[1] famous items ought to perk you[1] right up![0]
{2766}	 Do you know how to use items?[1]  [7] (I have no idea)[1]  [7] (Of course I do!)[0]
{2767}	        The door won't budge.[0]
{2768}	  They gaze into each other's eyes.[0]
{2769}	BOWSER: Mario, she's a bit shy.[2] Look the other way, will you?[0]
{2770}	BOOSTER: [1]                [12][12]A...[12][12]ha![0]
{2771}	TOADSTOOL: What should we do?![3] Booster is returning, isn't he?[2] I know! Hide somewhere and wait[1] until he opens the door.[0]
{2772}	BOOSTER: Right![3] Now, about the girl in my life,[1] who thinks I should marry her?[3] Well?[2] Speak up![0]
{2773}	SNIFIT 2: A wedding ceremony[1] would make a great PARTY![0]
{2774}	BOOSTER:[1] Ah, a party![2] We haven't had one of those.[3] It could be fun![2] So...what is a party?[0]
{2775}	SNIFIT 3: Well, you drink punch[1] and eat CAKE![1] ...I think.[0]
{2776}	SNIFIT 1: Boss, shouldn't we be[1] concentrating on the girl?[0]
{2777}	BOOSTER: Hmmm...[2] Drink punch...eat cake...?[1] It sounds...complicated.[3] I don't know if I can muster the[1] energy to do it...[2] Let's walk through it once![1] It's wedding rehearsal time![0]
{2778}	SNIFIT 1: [1] We will now begin the ceremony.[3] Walk down the aisle with the...[1] (hey someone make her smile!)[1] beautiful bride-to-be.[0]
{2779}	BOOSTER: Wait![2] Mario always shows up about now[1] to ruin the fun.[3] We've got to take that into[1] consideration, you know.[2] Someone go and get the Mario doll.[0]
{2780}	         You can move freely[1]         behind the curtains.[3]   Good luck hiding from Booster[1]            and his Snifits.[0]
{2781}	SNIFITS: [1]              It isn't here.[0]
{2782}	BOOSTER: Of course it's here![1] You lazy slobs couldn't find water[1] if you were fish![0]
{2783}	 It's behind those curtains![2] Number one, you go and look.[0]
{2784}	SNIFIT 1: [1]          Nope, it isn't here.[0]
{2785}	SNIFIT 1: [1]          Nope, it isn't here.[0]
{2786}	BOOSTER: I wouldn't go and lose[1] my Mario doll, you idiots![3] Argh!![2] Number two, YOU look, too![0]
{2787}	BOOSTER: We can't give up![1] It's gotta be here somewhere.[3] Number 3![1] It's your turn![0]
{2788}	SNIFITS 1 & 2: [1]          Nope, it isn't here.[0]
{2789}	BOOSTER: Wait a minute![0]
{2790}	BOOSTER: [1] This is better than a party![2] Look out, 'cause here I come![0]
{2791}	BOOSTER: Wait [5]a [5]second![2] It's right up there.[1] I found the Mario doll![0]
{2792}	BOOSTER: But we'll NEVER be[1] able to reach it up there.[2] Oh! The sorrow![0]
{2793}	 What AM I gonna do...?[0]
{2794}	 I'm about to lose it...sniffle...[0]
{2795}	BOOSTER: Goodness![2] You're so kind![1] Thank you for getting my doll.[0]
{2796}	 I'd like to reward you.[2] Here, take this.[0]
{2797}	           Got an “Amulet”[0]
{2798}	BOOSTER: May happiness follow[1] you, wherever you go.[0]
{2799}	 All right! Enough is enough...[2] Cancel the rehearsal, we're going[1] on with the show![0]
{2800}	BOOSTER: Here's the password![3][1]               [12][12][12][28][3][1][0]
{2801}	         Need the key to get in[0]
{2802}	          Got the “Room Key”[0]
{2803}	BOOSTER: G'na!!![2]               It's Mario![3] That's impossible![1] He made it past all my traps...[2] But we're gonna trip him up![0]
{2804}	BOOSTER: I'd love to stay and[1] chat, but I've a schedule to keep.[2] Move aside so I can open that[1] door.[0]
{2805}	BOWSER:[1] Booster has such a nice place...[1] I miss my fortress...[3] I miss the good old days...[2] Toadstool screaming in terror,[1] Mario rushing in to save her...[0]
{2806}	BOWSER:[1] Booster has such a nice place...[1] I miss my fortress...[3] I miss the good old days...[2] Toadstool screaming in terror,[1] Mario rushing in to save her...[0]
{2807}	 Oh geez, it's Mario![3] Oops[43][5] Okay, okay[43][5] Calm down![5][1] Don't let him see you like this![3] [1] [12][12]    “Hey, how have you been?”[3] NO! Not like that, dummy![5][1] Wrong tone![1] It needs more...confidence![0]
{2808}	BOWSER: ...[2] That voice! It's Toadstool![3] I thought she got away, but[1] she's been stuck HERE...[1] Mwa, ha, ha![3] Well...[2] I guess I'll be returning to my[1] castle now.[0]
{2809}	 YOU!![1] What're YOU doing HERE?![3] If...[5] Toadstool were at my[1] castle waiting to be rescued...[2] She'd be crying like a baby![0]
{2810}	[1]        Outta my way, shortie![0]
{2811}	               It's locked[0]
{2812}	BOWSER: What!?[1] You're STILL here?[3] That look on your face...[2] Mwa, ha, ha![1] I get it now![0]
{2813}	BOWSER: Yeah...[1] I'm a piece of work, ain't I?![3] All this power, AND looks too![1] I know, I know! You're thinking,[3] “A big strong guy like him would[1] be great to have along!” right?[2] I'm gonna do something I may[1] regret later...![0]
{2814}	 I'll let you join the “Koopa Troop”.[1] You can thank me later...[0]
{2815}	     Mario and his friends have[1]     joined the “Koopa Troop”![2]     (Or so they're pretending)[3] [1]      “Bowser” joins the group[0]
{2816}	BOWSER: You can turn around now.[0]
{2817}	BOWSER: She says she's been[1] locked up ever since she took a[1] bite out of Booster. So now...[3] She wants to help us stir up a[1] little trouble![1] Mwa, ha, ha!![0]
{2818}	BOOSTER: Hey everybody![2] Did you see someone behind the[1] curtains, or was it just me?[3] How creepy![1] It's a pain, but I think we should[1] check one more time.[0]
{2819}	BOOSTER: Well?[2] I really think someone's behind[1] those curtains![3] I think one more peek is necessary.[0]
{2820}	          Got the Room Key[0]
{2821}	      Take a look at Booster's[1]   family portraits in order from[1]     the oldest to the youngest.[0]
{2822}	  Remember to respect your elders.[0]
{2823}	TOADSTOOL: Oh?[0]
{2824}	 Did I just hear some voices?[3] It couldn't be...![0]
{2825}	 I can't believe it![2] It's...Mario![0]
{2826}	[1]             [12][12] Mario~!!![3][1]            [12][12] I'm up here![0]
{2827}	TOADSTOOL: Mario![2] You DID come to rescue me.[1] I was so frightened and lonely.[3] [12][12]But now that you're here...[0]
{2828}	TOADSTOOL: The door won't open?[3] I think we need Booster's spell[1] to undo the lock on it.[1] Oh, what should we do?[0]
{2829}	BOOSTER:[2] Ah~[5] HA[5][12]~[12]~[12]~[12]~[12]~[12]~[12]~[12]![12][0]
{2830}	ELDER: Found the pirate ship?[2] Don't give up now, the star is[1] almost in your hands.[0]
{2831}	ELDER: Found the pirate ship?[2] Don't give up now, the star is[1] almost in your hands.[0]
{2832}	 This is...the inn.[1] You may stay...for free.[2]  [7] (Thanks)[1]  [7] (I'll pass)[0]
{2833}	 Okay...[0]
{2834}	 They keep...spinning and spinning.[0]
{2835}	 Don't...tell me.[1] You want...supplies.[1] I know.[0]
{2836}	 Thank you...very much.[0]
{2837}	 If you...want to enter the ocean,[1] jump into...the whirlpools.[0]
{2838}	 You will find the village elder...[1] in his house. He is...the most[1] respected person here.[0]
{2839}	 You're...collecting stars, right?[1] Only...three more to go.[0]
{2840}	ELDER: Finally![2] It took you long enough![3] I am the ELDER of this village.[3] I got to my exalted station in life[1] by...pleasing my superiors,[1] which is something I do well.[3] A star has fallen into the ocean.[1] I need it for...a certain purpose.[2] You...must find it for me.[0]
{2841}	 In the middle...of the ocean is a[1] pirate...ship.[2] You'll find a...I mean, there's a...[0]
{2842}	 ...A pirate lives there![1] His name is...“Jonathan Jones”...[1] ...[5]He isn't...very nice...[0]
{2843}	 A star...has fallen into the sea.[2] The pirate...probably...[0]
{2844}	 I mean that...man...[1] ...Uh...“Jonathan Jones”...[1] probably...has it.[5] He's nasty.[0]
{2845}	 I'm...just a...customer.[0]
{2846}	ELDER: You'll find the star in[1] “Jonathan Jones'” territory.[1] Don't worry, you can beat him.[3] (At least I THINK you can.)[1] Hurry and bring back the star![0]
{2847}	 You...may not enter here.[1] This is...a restricted area.[0]
{2848}	 There is nothing of interest here.[1] Don't...bother looking inside.[0]
{2849}	                   Hey![2]          Someone's in there.[0]
{2850}	ELDER: Eee hee hee![2] You found the star![1] Well done![3] But your journey ends here.[1] You are so gullible![1] Don't you know who I am?[3] I'm “Yaridovich”, a member of[1] Smithy's gang.[2] Shocked?[3] It's no wonder![1] My impersonation of an ordinary[1] person was flawless.[0]
{2851}	YARIDOVICH: Your search for the[1] stars has worried Smithy.[3] So if I take that star back to him,[1] I'll earn brownie points.[1] THIS is the way to get ahead![0]
{2852}	 It's futile to try and fight me.[1] Just hand it over, nice and easy.[2]  [7] (Okay)[1]  [7] (Get serious!)[0]
{2853}	 So that's how you want to play it?[2] What do you think will happen[1] to the real inhabitants of[1] Seaside Town?[0]
{2854}	REAL ELDER: [1] What are you doing?[2] No! Don't do that![3][1]           [12]No please stop![3][1][12][12][12][12]            [43][12]ACK![12][43][12][43][12][43][0]
{2855}	YARIDOVICH: Now isn't it a shame[1] for an innocent old man to be[1] tickled...like this?[0]
{2856}	REAL ELDER: [1] No you wouldn't![2] The two of you are going to???[3] [12][12]Nooo![1] Please not there![3][1][12][12][12][12]        [43][12][43][12]Aiee[12][43][12][43][12][43][12]ee[43][12][43][12][43][12][0]
{2857}	REAL ELDER: [1] Harumph![2] You can't treat me this way![3] [12][12][12][12][12][12]Ayaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiieeeeeeeeee[1] aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiyaaaaaaaaaaaaa[1] aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa[12]e[12]e[12][12]e[12][12]e[12][12][43][12][12][43][3] [1]        [12][12]I can't bear[12] this[12]![12][43][12][12][12][43][0]
{2858}	REAL ELDER:[1] [12][43][12][43][12][43][12][43][12][43][12][43][0]
{2859}	YARIDOVICH: Eee hee hee![2] And to think I got the star without[1] even soiling my hands![3] I'm such a genius, it scares me[1] sometimes.[3] No wonder I'm so important![3] All right everyone, listen up.[1] We're returning to the castle![2] Our ride should be here about now.[0]
{2860}	YARIDOVICH: Blade's late.[2] What's taking him so long?[3] We need to get out of here.[0]
{2861}	YARIDOVICH: This is JUST great![2] Mario caught up with us.[3] Only one thing we can do now.[1] Although we may rust a little,[1] we'll have to swim for it.[0]
{2862}	JOHNNY: Not so fast there![2] That star's a gift to me mate,[1] Mario.[3] You spineless dogs have no[1] code of honor![3] We'll make you walk the plank![0]
{2863}	YARIDOVICH: Eee hee...![2] I guess we'll have to take our[1] disguises off now...[3] [1]          GROUP formation![0]
{2864}	 Johnny, maybe we should leave[1] Mario the pleasure of wrapping[1] things up here.[0]
{2865}	          Got the “Shed Key”[0]
{2866}	               It's locked[0]
{2867}	               It's locked[0]
{2868}	 Welcome to “Beetles Are Us”![3] We run a beetle business here.[3] Want an explanation?[1]  [7] (Yes)[1]  [7] (No)[0]
{2869}	 Ok, I'll explain the system.[3] First you need to purchase a[1] “Beetle Box”, which will cost you[1] 50 coins.[3] Then go to Booster Hill, where[1] there are many beetles.[3] If you bring back the Beetle Box[1] filled with beetles, you can trade[1] them in for coins, etc.[3] Check the menu list for more[1] information.[0]
{2870}	 Please come again.[0]
{2871}	 Welcome to “Beetles Are Us”![0]
{2872}	 If this is your first time, you need[1] to pay an initiation fee.[3] The fee is 100 coins.[1] Together with the 50 coins for[1] the Beetle Box, that's 150 coins.[3] Is it a deal?[1]  [7] (Ouch! Well, okay...)[1]  [7] (No, I'll pass)[0]
{2873}	 Come back with more CASH![0]
{2874}	 Thank you.[3] I need to see some ID please.[0]
{2875}	 Everything looks fine.[3] Here's your Beetle Box.[1] Good luck, and happy hunting![0]
{2876}	 You haven't even caught one?[1] Come on! Get serious![0]
{2877}	 A Beetle Box costs 50 coins.[2]  [7] (Okay)[1]  [7] (No thanks)[0]
{2878}	 Well then good luck to you![0]
{2879}	 Good job![2] You made [28][0] coin(s).[0]
{2880}	 Oh wow![2] You've got a Golden Beetle, too![1] Here's one Frog Coin.[0]
{2881}	 Good doing business with you.[0]
{2882}	 Good doing business with you.[0]
{2883}	 Phew, thanks so much![2] I've had enough of cramped,[1] dirty old places like this.[0]
{2884}	 Hey fella![2] You got us out of a bind![1] Peace brother![0]
{2885}	 It was mighty unpleasant in here.[2] Thanks for helpin' us out.[0]
{2886}	 Thank you![2] Yeah, thanks a lot![3] Be sure to stop by.[2] Yeah, stop on by.[0]
{2887}	 Thank you for freeing us.[3] I've got to get back to work now,[1] but stop by the inn![2] See ya there![0]
{2888}	ELDER: Ah, Mario.[3] Thank you for saving our little[1] town of Seaside.[0]
{2889}	 You exposed the fake townspeople,[1] and gave up your star to save us![3] Please take this with our thanks.[0]
{2890}	 They did torture me a little,[1] but it's nothing to worry about.[3] Here, this is for you.[0]
{2891}	 Although they tortured me, I'm[1] sure it was nothing compared to[1] your trials, Mario.[3] I'd hate to have to go through[1] that tickle torture again, though![3] I've gotta leave now, so please[1] take this.[0]
{2892}	 Being the most important person[1] in the village, it was inevitable[1] that I would be tortured.[3] Are you immune to tickle tortures,[1] Mario?[3] Oh yes...this is for you.[1] Please take it.[0]

{2899}	 Hi, Mario![3] We've got a lot of health foods[1] at our store.[1] You gotta treat your body right![0]
{2900}	 Hi, Mario![3] We've got a lot of health foods[1] at our store.[1] You gotta treat your body right![0]
{2901}	 Welcome to our store.[1] We encourage healthy lifestyles.[0]
{2902}	 Hey there![1] Remember me from the mines?[2] I found some neat stuff and I'm[1] opening up a “Miner's Store”.[3] Come and take a look at what[1] I've got to sell.[0]
{2903}	 Oh hello there![2] You were so brave to rescue us,[1] and I'm so thankful...[3] But listen...maybe it's time you[1] thought a little more about[1] what you...wear...[3] Accessorizing is big business[1] these days![1] See anything you like here?[0]
{2904}	 Let's see if we can't make you[1] look a little more snazzy.[1] That blue-collar look is SO dated! [0]
{2905}	 Good to see you again.[2] I'll show you my inventory.[0]
{2906}	 Please come in and browse.[1] I'm running an armor shop![0]
{2907}	 Welcome to my weapons shop.[0]
{2908}	 Item #2: A “Mystery Egg”.[1] I have no idea what it does![1] It sort of grows on ya, huh?[2] It's yours for 200 coins.[1]  [7] (Okay)[1]  [7] (No thanks)[0]
{2909}	 That's all I've got for now.[0]
{2910}	 You need more coins![2] I gotta eat, you know![0]
{2911}	 Item #1: A “Lucky Jewel”![1] It's sure to bring you plenty of[1] good luck.[2] I'll sell it to you for 100 coins.[1]  [7] (It's a deal)[1]  [7] (I'll pass)[0]
{2912}	 Nice doing business with you.[1] Here you go![0]
{2913}	 Oops, I didn't realize I was out[1] of inventory.[3] Check back with me occasionally.[1] You may find something you like![0]
{2914}	 Item #3: A “Metal Plate”.[2] Don't know what it's used for,[1] but I'll sell it for 300 coins.[1]  [7] (I'll take it)[1]  [7] (No thanks)[0]
{2915}	 Mario, how nice of you to stop by.[3] It's quite a trek from your place,[1] isn't it?[3] Out here, there aren't many people[1] passing through, so it gets awful[1] lonely sometimes...[0]
{2916}	 Please rest up before you go.[1] It'll only cost you 15 coins.[2]  [7] (Okay)[1]  [7] (No)[0]
{2917}	 Okay, some other time then.[1] Have a safe trip.[0]
{2918}	 You don't have enough coins?[3] That's ok, just pay me whatever[1] you can.[1] I know you need to rest.[0]
{2919}	 Hello there.[2] You're Mario, right?[3] Do you remember me?[1] We met at Tadpole Pond, when I[1] was still a tadpole.[3] I've graduated from Frogfucius'[1] school, and now I'm searching for[1] the meaning of life.[0]
{2920}	 It's been so quiet around here,[1] it's almost eerie...[1] Is something going on?[3] [12][12][12]It probably doesn't concern me.[1] But if you have any Frog Coins,[1] I've got some neat items to sell.[0]
{2921}	 Good to see you again.[1] Did you have a chance to[1] accumulate many Frog Coins?[0]
{2922}	 It was really quiet around here[1] until a little while ago.[1] What happened?[3] [12][12][12]That reminds me, do you have[1] any Frog Coins?[1] I've got some special items to sell.[0]
{2923}	ELDER: Smithy and his gang have[1] disrupted business around here.[3] Why don't you help us out and do[1] some shopping before you leave?[0]
{2924}	ELDER: Mario, if it's a star that[1] you're looking for, I may be able[1] to help you.[3] At the far side of “Land's End”[1] is a town made up of reformed[1] monsters.[3] A mouse came by the other day,[1] and I overheard him boasting[1] about a “star” of theirs.[3] I don't know exactly where this[1] town is located, but if you follow[1] the road, you'll get there.[0]
{2925}	 By the way, have you met my, uh,[1] long-term houseguest, who's taken[1] over my second floor?[0]
{2926}	 Speaking of items, it looks like[1] you've got too many and can't[1] carry them all.[0]
{2927}	 Oops, sorry I'm all out of items.[3] In other words,[1]          “Come back later!”[2] So...good day to you![0]
{2928}	 Hey, hey, HEY!![2] I'm the Mushroom Boy![3] Did you know that hidden amongst[1] the regular mushrooms, are some[1] special ones? Unreal huh?[3] I'll give you items in return for[1] those special mushrooms.[3] But you've got to taste them to[1] find out what kind they are.[2] So I'll take a nibble first.[3] I'm hoping for a special mushroom,[1] but even if it isn't, at least I'll[1] get a meal out of it.[0]
{2929}	 You have any mushrooms?[1]  [7] (Yes)[1]  [7] (Nope)[0]
{2930}	 Hey, far out![1] Munch munch munch.[0]
{2931}	 That was just a regular mushroom![1] Thanks for the snack.[0]
{2932}	 Ooh![2] This one's a “Berry Mushroom”![3] I'll give you a “Maple Syrup”.[1] Oh boy, I'm stuffed.[0]
{2933}	 All right![2] Like, this is unreal![1] It's a “Rippin Mushroom”.[3] So I'll give you a “Rock Candy”.[1] Hey thanks a lot![0]
{2934}	 Whooeee![2] This is most excellent![1] It's a “Flower Mushroom”.[3] I'll give you a “Flower Tab” for it.[1] Hey, thanks, dude.[0]
{2935}	 See you around, man.[1] Come again, all right?[0]
{2936}	 Hey you don't have any mushrooms.[0]
{2937}	      Received a “Maple Syrup”[0]
{2938}	      Received a “Rock Candy”[0]
{2939}	       Received a “Flower Tab”[0]
{2940}	 Would you like an explanation on[1]       how to “Switch” allies?[2]  [7] (Yes)[1]  [7] (No)[0]
{2941}	 Oh, I see.[2] You're just so well-traveled and[1] experienced, Mario![0]
{2942}	TOAD: ... and that's how it's done.[2] Now you can get a boost whenever[1] you're feeling tired.[0]
{2943}	 [12]Uh, now why did I rush back?[1] I had...something to tell you.[0]
{2944}	 Ack, I remember![2] I came to warn you that Mushroom[1] Way is swarming with monsters![3] I just barely made it back here[1] in one piece![1] Mario, please do something.[3] [12]Perhaps I can help.[1] Do you know about “Timed Hits”?[2]  [7] (No)[1]  [7] (Yes)[0]
{2945}	 Okay, allow me to explain.[2] First we'll enter a battle.[0]
{2946}	 Hey, you better watch out![1] He knows about Timed Hits.[3] He's gonna punch your lights out![0]
{2947}	TOAD: ...and there you are![2] Now, at least you have a fighting[1] chance against those monsters![0]
{2948}	 That's right![2] We need to tell the Chancellor[1] about Toadstool![3] I'll see you over at Mushroom[1] Kingdom.[3] Just in case, take these with you.[0]
{2949}	 He's got more bark than bite, huh?[0]
{2950}	[1]         Thanks for coming by.[0]
{2951}	[1]         Thanks for coming by.[0]

{2957}	[1]         Thanks for coming by.[0]
{2958}	[1]            See you around.[0]
{2959}	         Got the “Temple Key”[0]
{2960}	 You there![1] Rumor has it that you're quite[1] an accomplished jumper.[0]
{2961}	 I may be out-jumped,[1] but you're totally out-pumped![0]
{2962}	 ...The strong, silent type, eh?[0]
{2963}	 Don't you dig these vibes?[0]
{2964}	 Hi, I'm The Big Boo.[0]
{2965}	 And I'm Dry Bones...[0]
{2966}	 Nice to meet ya! I'm Greaper.[0]
{2967}	    We are the 3 “Musty Fears”![0]

{2969}	DRY BONES:[1] Boy, he sure is.[0]
{2970}	THE BIG BOO:[1] Check those bubbles[1] coming out of his nose![0]
{2971}	MONSTERMAMA:[1] So! You wanna go there?[1] Ha! You're an open book![3] Ok, here's what you need to do.[1] There's a secret passage to the[1] sky at...Bean Valley![3] But first you must scale the cliff[1] beyond the desert to get there.[3] Since you're such a nice guy, I'll[1] introduce you to someone that can[1] help you.[0]
{2972}	MONSTERMAMA: Starbees...?[2] Oh, Star Piece![1] Nope, not familiar with 'em.[3] So you came all the way out here[1] to search for a Star Piece?[1] It must be REALLY important.[3] This is the last place on land.[1] If you can't find it here...[3] [1]       The only place left, is UP![0]
{2973}	MONSTERMAMA:[1] So what do you think?[1] Isn't our star adorable?[3] She's so talented too![1] Folks come to see her from afar.[0]
{2974}	MONSTERMAMA:[1] If it's a star you're looking for,[1] there's one upstairs.[0]
{2975}	MONSTERMAMA: A star, you say?[2] Oh you're here to see OUR star![3] She's upstairs, so feel free to go[1] and take a look for yourself.[0]
{2976}	MONSTERMAMA:[1] Oh, my! A traveler from afar.[3] Welcome to Monstro Town, where[1] many of our kind mingle.[1] I'm the landlady, Monstermama.[0]
{2977}	 Yes, just a minute![1] I'll be there in a second.[0]
{2978}	 Oh my![0]
{2979}	BOWSER:[1] Goomba, what are you doing here?[0]
{2980}	GOOMBA: Bowser...[1] It's been ages, hasn't it?[3] Sorry about going AWOL on you.[1] I ran away because I was scared[1] to fight Smithy.[3] A lot has happened since then,[1] but look how far I've come.[1] I'm managing this store now.[3] And look, here are my little ones.[1] Come on, show your manners and[1] greet Uncle Bowser.[0]
{2981}	TRIPLETS: [1]           Hi Uncle Bowser![0]
{2982}	 Although I can't fight for you,[1] I still have some items you can use.[3] Maybe you'll find it in your heart[1] to forgive me if I can help you get[1] equipped![0]
{2983}	TRIPLETS:[1] We want to help too![1] Please, please, can we?[0]
{2984}	GOOMBA: What can I get you?[0]
{2985}	GOOMBA:[1] Please come back again.[1] You'll always get VIP service.[0]
{2986}	BOWSER: [43][43][5][43][43][5]Don't worry.[3] I'm not angry with you.[1] I've got new troops now, and[1] we're going to reclaim my castle![3] You go on with your life here.[2] I wish you the best.[0]

{2988}	[1]        Sky Troopas, I need you![0]
{2989}	THE BIG BOO: Maybe he can still[1] hear us while he's asleep?[3] Hey you! We want to play a round[1] of “Find the Flag”.[0]
{2990}	GREAPER: Right![1] We'll each hide a flag[1] somewhere around the world.[0]
{2991}	DRY BONES: Yeah.[1] Find all three flags, and[1] you'll get an awesome prize.[0]
{2992}	3 MUSTY FEARS:[1] We'll go and hide the flags.[3] See you when we get back![0]
{2993}	 They'll be back![0]
{2994}	GREAPER: I'm back![2] I hid my flag...[1] behind a wooden flower.[0]
{2995}	DRY BONES: I'm hooooome![2] My flag's under a green bed.[0]
{2996}	THE BIG BOO: I'm back![2] You'll never guess my spot![1] It's between “O” and “A”.[3] Our flags are invisible, so search[1] VERY carefully when you think[1] you've found the spot![0]
{2997}	3 MUSTY FEARS:[1] Don't forget what we told you![0]
{2998}	GREAPER:[1] My flag's behind a wooden flower.[0]
{2999}	GREAPER:[1] So you found my flag, huh?[0]
{3000}	DRY BONES:[1] My flag's underneath a green bed.[0]
{3001}	DRY BONES:[1] Oh, you found my flag![0]

{3005}	       Found “Dry Bones' Flag”![0]
{3006}	3 MUSTY FEARS: Good job![1] You found all three flags.[0]
{3007}	GREAPER:[1] Hey, you're not half bad![0]
{3008}	DRY BONES:[1] You did pretty well![0]
{3009}	THE BIG BOO:[1] We had a great time, too.[1] Thanks for playing our game![0]

{3018}	SERGEANT FLUTTER:[1] Sky Troopas reporting for duty,[1] MA'AM![3] We're 0.52 seconds late![3] I hold myself personally[1] accountable for the delay, Ma'am![0]
{3019}	MONSTERMAMA:[1] Still as rigid as ever about your[1] rules and regulations?[3] No need to bother with the[1] protocol around me, Sergeant.[1] I've got a favor to ask of you.[0]
{3020}	SERGEANT FLUTTER:[1] Yes Ma'am![1] Anything we can do for a civilian.[0]
{3021}	MONSTERMAMA:[1] This fellow here REALLY wants to[1] get to Bean Valley.[3] Could you help him scale the cliff?[0]
{3022}	SERGEANT FLUTTER:[1] Understood, Ma'am![3] The orders are:[1] “Get Mustache over the cliff”![2] We WILL succeed![0]
{3023}	 We will now deploy ourselves to[1] the cliff at Land's End.[3] Troopas, keep a tight formation![0]
{3024}	 We have lift off![0]
{3025}	MONSTERMAMA:[1] They're odd, but trustworthy![1] Good luck with your search![0]

{3027}	 Who is it?[1] Sorry, but the Sensei isn't in.[0]

{3030}	BOWSER:[1]               Jagger?![0]
{3031}	JAGGER: Bowser![1] I haven't seen you for so long.[3] I've been studying here at the[1] dojo under the Sensei “Jinx”[1] because...[3] To tell you the truth, I...[1] I knew I couldn't beat Smithy.[3] That's why I'm here now.[1] Someday I'm going to return and[1] make you proud![0]
{3032}	BOWSER: [43][5][43][5]Don't worry about me.[3] I've got new Troopas now, and[1] we're going to take back my castle.[3] You stick to your guns![2] Train like there's no tomorrow![0]
{3033}	JAGGER: My Sensei is out right[1] now, but he'll be back shortly.[3] In the meantime, will you accept a[1] challenge from me?[2]  [7] (Sure)[1]  [7] (No)[0]
{3034}	JAGGER: Wow![1] I'm flattered to think that YOU'RE[1] afraid of me.[0]
{3035}	JAGGER: Great![1] You know that I'm not going to[1] make it easy for you, right?[0]
{3036}	JAGGER: Yea! I did it![1] I never thought I'd beat Mario![3] You didn't let me win did you?[1] Come back anytime, and we'll try[1] it again if you want.[0]
{3037}	JAGGER: Yikes![1] I guess that was to be expected.[3] Mario, you're a top-notch fighter![0]
{3038}	???:[1] You did well for your inexperience,[1] Jagger.[0]
{3039}	JAGGER:[1] Sensei![1] Have you been here all along?[0]
{3040}	JINX: Hmmm.[1] You felt my Ki, didn't you?[1] Not bad for a novice![0]
{3041}	JINX: Your fighting style...[1] It isn't as foolproof as you think.[0]
{3042}	JINX: Your fighting style...[1] It isn't as foolproof as you think.[0]
{3043}	JINX: You wish to challenge me?[1]  [7] (Yes)[1]  [7] (No)[0]
{3044}	JAGGER:[1] Now this should be interesting.[1] Can you beat THE master, Mario?[0]
{3045}	JINX: Tsk tsk.[1] Afraid are we?[0]
{3046}	JINX: All right.[1] Let's see what you're capable of.[0]
{3047}	JINX:[1]    I'll accept a challenge any day.[0]
{3048}	JINX: Do you know what your weak[1] point is? You haven't put in[1] enough training time.[3] But don't worry, in time you'll[1] grow stronger.[1] Come back after you level up.[0]
{3049}	JINX: All right, you asked for it.[1] And no crying if you get hurt![0]
{3050}	JINX: Watch closely, Jagger.[1] You're about to see your Sensei[1] in action.[0]
{3051}	JINX: I guess I underestimated you.[1] You pack quite a punch![3] But don't let it go to your head,[1] because I let you HAVE that round.[1] Let's have a rematch.[0]
{3052}	JINX: Still haven't had enough?[3] It isn't often that I have someone[1] this competitive to spar with![3] All right, this match will be the [1] one that counts, since I'm placing[1] my reputation on the line![0]
{3053}	JINX: How disappointing![1] Running away during the middle of[1] a match?[3] Come back when you've leveled up[1] sufficiently, and we'll try again.[0]
{3054}	[1]                Greetings.[3][1]  I am Culex, Dark Knight of Vanda.[3] I have crossed into this dimension[1]     to fight for the Dark Mage.[3]   But this world is uninhabitable[1]          for me and my kind.[1]   I must return to my own world.[3]  Before I go, though, I would like[1] to challenge your strongest knight.[3]    Will you accept my challenge?[0]

{3057}	 You will enter combat against me?[2]   [7] (Yes)[1]   [7] (Uh...)[0]
{3058}	      You are wise to hesitate.[3]   Without any weapon or armor,[1]         you have no chance.[0]
{3059}	CULEX: [1]    You have returned to accept[1]             my challenge?[3]        Now will you fight me?[1]  [7] (Yes)[1]  [7] (No)[0]

{3100}	GARDENER: This is unreal! This is[1] just like winning the lottery, only[1] without the taxes! I mean, this is[1] like falling out of an airplane[1] without a parachute, and hitting[1] a gaggle of geese in mid-air who[1] break your fall. Wait until my[1] buddies over at Happy Gardener's[1] Monthly hear about this. I'm going[1] to be famous! Maybe even get my[1] picture in the next issue.[13][24][6]

{3118}	GENO: Frogfucius mentioned hearing[1] about a Star Piece on this hill.[0]
{3119}	GENO: Let's see if we can find it.[0]

{3123}	MALLOW: Why, this wish is...[3] It's from my mom and dad.[3] They're wishing for me to come[1] home![0]
{3124}	MALLOW: [1] This isn't the time to be crying![2] They're waiting for me to come[1] home![0]

{3134}	BOWSER: And you, Mario![2] You're an official member of the[1] Koopa Troop. It's your duty to[1] help with the repairs![0]
{3135}	GENO: Bowser, you're completely[1] missing the point.[0]
{3136}	BOWSER: Gwaa?![12][12][12][12][3] I oughtta rip your stuffing out![0]
{3137}	GENO: No, think about it, Bowser.[2] This sword connects the two[1] worlds, right?[0]
{3138}	BOWSER: Yeah, so?[0]
{3139}	GENO: Even IF we defeat Exor...[2] There will be OTHER weapon beasts[1] to follow him.[0]

{3179}	TOAD: Hey![1] Where did this hammer come from?[0]
{3180}	TOAD: Hmm[12][43][12][43][12][12][12][1] Hey, do you know what THIS is?![0]
{3181}	TOAD: It has the Hammer Bro's[1] insignia on it.[2] No one stands a chance against[1] you when you whomp them with this.[0]
{3182}	TOAD: Let's get a move on![2] I'll see you in Mushroom Kingdom.[0]
{3183}	 Here, you can have this.[0]
{3184}	BOWYER: 997! 998! 999! 1000![1] Nya ha ha! 1000 arrows![2] For cover they run, nya![1] FUN this is, yes.[1] Nya! Another 1000 will I shoot![0]
{3185}	MALLOW: Mario, who IS that guy?[1] [12][12]He must be the one shooting[1] arrows at Rose Town![0]
{3186}	BOWYER: Happy I am, nya![1] Look...LOOK at their expressions[1] when freeze they do![0]
{3187}	FLUNKIES: Woo hoo![1] They're standing like statues![0]
{3188}	BOWYER: Nya![1] More practice do I need![0]
{3189}	MALLOW: Oh no![1] He's not stopping![1] We've got to do something![0]
{3190}	MALLOW: Who do you think you are,[1] Bruce Lee? You can't just go in[1] there with your fists flying![0]
{3191}	MALLOW: Oh no, someone's coming![1] Let's hide and see if we can[1] learn anything.[0]
{3192}	MALLOW: There're too many of 'em.[1] We'll be creamed![0]
{3193}	 Look what I found, Bowyer![0]
{3194}	BOWYER: What? WHAT?[1] Disturb me you must not![1] Practicing, I am.[2] More arrows must I shoot![1] More statues must I make, nya![0]
{3195}	???:[1]                   Stop![0]
{3196}	???: Hold it right there![1] You don't know what you're doing.[1] RETURN that star to me![0]
{3197}	BOWYER: Gnya, NYA!?[1] A stranger you are...[1] and strange looking at that![2] Teach you, we must,[1] who's in charge![0]
{3198}	???: Thanks for the help.[1] You really got me out of a jam.[3] Why are you staring at me?[1] You know I'm more than just[1] a doll, don't you?[0]
{3199}	???: Have you guessed the truth?[12][1] I'm a visitor from above, and this[1] is a form I'm borrowing briefly.[0]
{3200}	MALLOW: You mean, like, from the[1] sky or something?[0]
{3201}	???: Higher than that, I'm afraid![12][12][12][2] Do you two know anything about[1] the “Star Road”?[0]
{3202}	???: Completely in the dark, eh?[12][12][12][1] Well, it's a big mess up there right[1] now, and it concerns you too![12][12][3] Let me explain...[3] You've heard of wishing upon a[1] shooting star?[0]
{3203}	???: At the “Star Road”, your[1] wish is transformed into a star.[2] When it's granted, it then turns[1] into a shooting star and falls[1] down to earth.[3] So you see, the Star Road plays an[1] integral role in granting wishes.[3] But ever since a sword destroyed[1] the “Star Road”, everything's[1] come to a halt.[3] No stars have been made since.[2] The way things stand,[5] yours is a[1] world where wishes can't come[1] true anymore.[0]
{3204}	MALLOW: Are you saying THIS star[1] is a part of your “Starway”?[0]
{3205}	???: That's “STAR ROAD”, my[1] fluffy little friend ...[3] Yes, [5]that star is a broken piece[1] of the Star Road.[3] I'm here to find them all, and[1] repair the Star Road.[0]
{3206}	???: [1] The broken Star Pieces...[2] There are 7 altogether.[0]
{3207}	???: For peace to return...[2] we must get rid of Smithy,[1] find the Star Pieces, and repair[1] the Star Road..[0]
{3208}	???: I'm “[36][37]!?”, but it's hard to[1] pronounce so...[2] Call me “Geno”, after the doll.[3] I chose him because he looked the[1] strongest out of all the dolls.[0]
{3209}	 “Geno”, who is searching for the[1]  pieces of the Star Road, joins[1]         Mario and Mallow.[3] Things are definitely looking up![0]
{3210}	GENO: Now grab the star, Mario![0]
{3211}	 Ooh, I heard everything![12][1] Who would have known that star[1] was so important?[3] I've got to inform Smithy![0]
{3212}	GENO: Come on![1] Let's get this show on the road.[0]
{3213}	[1]        Pick up a “Mushroom”[0]
{3214}	GARDENER: Hey![1] I haven't finished yet.[0]
{3215}	GARDENER: Short attention span?[0]
{3216}	GARDENER: Hi, I'm the gardener.[12][12][12][1] See that huge planter?[3] I've spent many years seeking the[1] legendary “Seed” and “Fertilizer”[1] to fill it with, but had no luck.[3] Sigh...if I could only find them![0]
{3217}	GARDENER: Incredible![1] I can't believe it! It's the[1] legendary “Seed” I've read about[1] in the ancient gardening texts.[1] These are so rare! Can you even[1] begin to comprehend what a huge[1] discovery this is? I've spent my[1] whole life searching for one![1] It's too much, I tell ya![13][24][6]
{3218}	GARDENER: Egads![1] Do you know what you have there?[1] That fertilizer comes from the[1] Shy Away clan, famous for its[1] miraculous feats of gardening. I[1] looked for it beyond the cliffs,[1] even tried Bean Valley, but failed.[1] I've traveled around the world and[1] waited a lifetime for some of that[1] fertilizer you've got there![13][24][6]
{3219}	GARDENER: Well, that's my story.[2] Say...will you give me the “Seed”?[1]  [7]  (Sure)[1]  [7]  (Nope)[0]
{3220}	GARDENER: Yes, you might say I[1] have fertilizer on the brain.[2] Will you give it to me?[1]  [7]  (Sure)[1]  [7]  (Sorry)[0]
{3221}	GARDENER: You changed your mind?[2]  [7]  (Yes)[1]  [7]  (No)[0]
{3222}	GARDENER: Well, Mario?[2] Will you give me the fertilizer?[1]  [7]  (Yes)[1]  [7]  (No)[0]
{3223}	GARDENER: I finally have it![3] This is extraordinary![0]
{3224}	 May I have the fertilizer?[1]  [7]  (Yes)[1]  [7]  (No)[0]
{3225}	GARDENER: Sigh...[1] What ever happened to granting[1] an old man's wishes?[0]
{3226}	GARDENER: Oh thank you![2] I finally have both the “Seed” and[1] the “Fertilizer”.[2] I'll try them out right away.[0]
{3227}	GARDENER: I'd be so happy if I[1] only had the “Seed”![3] I'm sooo disappointed.[0]
{3228}	GARDENER: I finally have it![2] But without the “Seed”,[1] it's useless.[0]
{3229}	 You're giving me the fertilizer too?[1]  [7]  (Yes)[1]  [7]  (No)[0]
{3230}	GARDENER: Gals don't care for[1] tightwads, you know![0]
{3231}	FACTORY CHIEF: Mario![12][12][1] I'm surprised to see you here.[0]
{3232}	FACTORY CHIEF: But this is the[1] end of the line for you.[2] This is the closest you'll ever get[1] to Smithy, so savor the moment.[0]
{3233}	FACTORY CHIEF: Harrumph![1] You'll be fodder for my incredible[1] invention, the “Gunyolk”![0]
{3234}	POUNDER #1: Sir![12][12][1] “Drill Bit” will be finished on time.[0]
{3235}	POUNDER #2: [1]       We're ahead of schedule![0]
{3236}	POUNDER #3: [1]       We'll make Smithy proud![0]
{3237}	POUNDER: Here's the report![0]
{3238}	MANAGER: Good work, everyone.[12][12][12][1] The harder we work, the stronger[1] Smithy will become![0]
{3239}	MANAGER: The weapons we[1] manufacture here will be...[3][1]           Just think of it...[0]
{3240}	MANAGER: When Smithy takes over[1] Mario's world, we can do anything[1] we want![0]
{3241}	[1]              Gwah, ha, ha...[13][48][6]
{3242}	BOWSER:[1]              Not so fast![3][1]     You sure are a cocky bunch![0]
{3243}	BOWSER: I rule this world![1] Don't you forget it![0]
{3244}	MANAGER: It's Mario![2] Mack 2 and Yaridovich 2 didn't[1] stop him?[0]
{3245}	BOWSER: No, NO! Leave Mario[1] outta this. I'm the one you need[1] to worry about, not him![0]
{3246}	MANAGER: Mario, you're about to[1] make the longest jump of your life![0]
{3247}	BOWSER: Y...You're ignoring me![0]
{3248}	CLERK: [1] Production is on schedule?[3] This, despite the fact that Mack,[1] Bowyer, Yaridovich, and the Axem[1] Rangers were defeated.[2] At this rate, Smithy will have a[1] new army in no time![0]
{3249}	MALLOW: A...new army?[3] You can't be making more weapons![1] Haven't you caused enough trouble[1] already?[0]
{3250}	CLERK: What did you say, you[1] little puff ball?[1] [12][12]Mad Mallet! TRASH 'em![0]
{3251}	CLERK: All right, let's see[1] whatcha got![0]
{3252}	CLERK: [1] Oh yeah?! Who are you?[0]
{3253}	MALLOW: This is THE Mario![3] Give up now, while you still have[1] a chance![3] Shut down production NOW,[1] or he'll...STOMP ya![0]
{3254}	MALLOW: Ha![1] Hope you learned your lesson![0]
{3255}	MALLOW: [1] We're almost there, Mario.[2] Come on![0]
{3256}	MALLOW: What do you suppose[1] this switch does? Hmm...[0]
{3257}	MALLOW: [1]         Ack! Help me, Mario![0]
{3258}	MALLOW: [43][12][43][12][43][12]Nothing's happening.[0]
{3259}	MALLOW: Huh?[1] What's with the funny face, Mario?[3] Oh I KNOW, you're trying to make[1] me look, aren't you?[12][12][1] I'm not going to fall for that one![0]
{3260}	MALLOW: Boy, that was scary![1] I guess the green switch controls[1] the crane.[0]
{3261}	GENO: Hmm[43][12][43][12][43][12][2] The production line hasn't halted.[0]
{3262}	GENO: This must be where Smithy[1] makes his weapons.[3] To find the last Star Piece and[1] stop the factory, we've got to[1] defeat him first.[0]
{3263}	GENO: Mario...[1] There's no turning back now.[1] Are you ready?[0]
{3264}	GENO: Our quest is almost over.[0]
{3265}	GENO: And when the time comes[43][12][43][12][43][12][0]
{3266}	GENO: Look Mario, this is where the[1] weapons come from.[0]
{3267}	[1][1]                Nya ha ha.[13][48][6]
{3268}	              Heh heh heh...[13][48][6]
{3269}	 Like the moon over[13][32] [1] the day, my genius and brawn[13][32][1] are lost on these fools. [13][32]~Haiku[0]
{3270}	TOADSTOOL: You there![12][12][1] Are you the one in charge here?[3] Do you know what your weapons[1] have been doing to our world?[3] Stop this nonsense at once![0]
{3271}	DIRECTOR:[1]    I'm afraid that isn't possible. [3] Any dissent against Smithy will be[1] dealt with by immediate melt down.[0]
{3272}	TOADSTOOL: [1]             M, melt down?[3] You can't scare me, I've got[1] Mario by my side![0]
{3273}	DIRECTOR: [1]     Dissenters will be eliminated![1]       Production will continue.[0]
{3274}	TOADSTOOL:[1]            That was scary![3] But we can't run away now.[2] We've got to kick these lowlifes[1] out of our world.[0]

{3296}	DEALER: If you would like to play,[1] please go to the other side of[1] the table.[0]
{3297}	DEALER: In Blackjack, whomever[1] comes the closest to 21 points,[1] without going over, wins.[3] I will first deal 2 cards, then we[1] will each draw as many cards as[1] we wish.[3] Once we stop drawing cards, we[1] both show our hand, and whomever[1] has the higher total wins.[3] But if your hand exceeds 21, your[1] opponent wins, regardless of how[1] many points they have.[3] So if you exceed 21, you'll lose.[3] If I go over 21, you'll win.[3] To play, you'll need 1 Frog Coin.[3] If you win, you'll get 1 Frog Coin,[1] but if it's a tie or you lose, I'll[1] keep it.[3] So how about it?[2] Would you like to play Blackjack?[1]  [7] (Yes)[1]  [7] (No)[0]

{3339}	JINX: Whoa[12][12][43][43][43][2] You ARE the stronger champion,[1] no doubt about it.[3] My reputation was staked on this[1] last fight, so I've lost the title[1] of “Sensei”.[3] From today, you are the Sensei[1] of this dojo.[3] Please take this belt, which only[1] the highest ranking fighter in the[1] dojo can wear.[0]

{3348}	VALENTINA: What?[2] You saw a statue move?[1] Don't be ridiculous.[3] You're just stalling, so you won't[1] have to polish them![0]
{3349}	VALENTINA: What?[1] The statue was “ticklish”?[2] Is that what you said?[3] If you try stalling just one more[1] time, I'm gonna have your feathers[1] plucked for my pillow. Now SCAT![0]
{3350}	VALENTINA: STOP BOTHERING ME![2] If you're so worried, why don't[1] you go give it a good peck![0]

{3388}	FROGFUCIUS: Have you been to[1] Seaside Town yet?[1] Something odd is going on there.[0]
{3389}	FROGFUCIUS: Beware of the giant[1] squid in the sunken ship. Turn 'im[1] into calamari or something![0]
{3390}	FROGFUCIUS: The entrance to[1] Monstro Town is underground.[1] Follow the whirls in the desert.[0]
{3391}	FROGFUCIUS: I JUST found out that[1] there's a kingdom in the clouds.[1] Go and explore it, my children.[0]
{3392}	 Was that too much to absorb?[1] Would you like a recap?[2]  [7] (Sure)[1]  [7] (Nope)[0]
{3393}	 Okay, here's the gist of it![1] Smithy invaded our world and took[1] over Bowser's Keep.[3] Toadstool and Bowser were thrown[1] by the impact, and now Smithy and[1] his cohorts are on a rampage.[3] The shooting stars are somehow[1] connected to this disturbance and[1] they're the key to defeating Smithy.[0]
{3394}	 Would you like me to repeat that?[1]  [7] (Yes)[1]  [7] (No)[0]
{3395}	 It's quite a situation we have on[1] our hands, isn't it?[0]

{3398}	MALLOW: Yep. I'm not giving up![0]
{3399}	FROGFUCIUS: You've got to defeat[1] Valentina and save Nimbus Land.[0]
{3400}	FROGFUCIUS: Ah! Now the people[1] of Nimbus Land can rejoice.[3] SO![1] I hear the next Star Piece is[1] inside a volcano.[3] I also heard that Booster got[1] himself another bride from the sky.[0]
{3401}	FROGFUCIUS: So...only Bowser's[1] Keep remains.[3] The citizens of Nimbus Land will[1] tell you how to get there.[0]
{3402}	FROGFUCIUS: [1] That's all the advice I have.[3] You've done well. All that's left[1] to do is to defeat Smithy.[3] Save this world, and bring this[1] quest to a happy end![0]

{3605}	 Look! There's a note.[1] Let's read it.[0]
{3606}	     King Nimbus is resting in bed.[2] Absolutely NO RUNNING in the halls.[1]            Queen Valentina[0]
{3607}	MALLOW: This can only mean that[1] my mom and dad are here![0]
{3608}	 Oh, but it's locked![0]
{3609}	 [1]             Leave it to me![0]
{3610}	BOWSER: Looks like it's up to me[1] to get us out of yet another jam.[2] Feast your eyes on this show of[1] brains...[12][12][12][12]and brawn![0]
{3611}	[1]              STAND BACK! [0]
{3612}	MALLOW:[1]         WAIT! Wait a minute![0]
{3613}	 If my dad's really bedridden,[1] we shouldn't make so much noise.[2] ...[12][12][12]We need another plan...[0]
{3614}	 I guess we should find Valentina[1] and force the truth out of her![0]
{3615}	BOWSER:[1]     But, what about the door?[12][12]...[0]
{3616}	SHY AWAY:[1]            Queen Valentina...[0]
{3617}	[4] That Mario creature who[1] beat up Smilax is here...[0]
{3618}	VALENTINA: Mario...?![2] What[12]...[12]does a “Mario”[1] look like?[0]
{3619}	SHY AWAY: Well...it has a bushy[1] mustache, long sideburns, and,[1] uh, a pair of[12][12]...[2] mean looking legs...![0]
{3620}	VALENTINA: [12]Hmmm...[12][1] I have the feeling I've seen this[1] “Mario” before...[0]
{3621}	VALENTINA: [12]...[12]Wait! Yes![1] It was that statue that Garro[1] just delivered...![0]
{3622}	SHY AWAY:[12][12] What, what, what[1] are we gonna do? What are we[1] GONNA DO, VALENTINA?[0]
{3623}	VALENTINA: Well, we certainly[1] aren't going to listen to your[1] pointless chatter.[3] Frankly speaking, I'm not going[1] to worry. Without this key, the[1] King can't go ANYWHERE![0]
{3624}	VALENTINA:[1]                  Hush...[0]
{3625}	VALENTINA:[1]      I SAID SHUT UP, ALREADY![0]
{3626}	VALENTINA: What the...?![1] That...that isn't a STATUE!![12][12][1] That's...[12][12]Mario!!![0]
{3627}	MALLOW: VALENTINA!![2] Hand over the KEY!!, NOW![0]
{3628}	VALENTINA: How utterly rude![1] And who in blazes are YOU[1] anyway?![0]
{3629}	MALLOW: Me?[1] I'm the REAL prince, that's who![0]
{3630}	VALENTINA: Brat![2] And how DARE you listen in on a[1] private conversation...![0]
{3631}	MALLOW: Private? PRIVATE?![1] Everyone in a 10 mile radius[1] could hear you![0]
{3632}	VALENTINA: Harrumph![1] If you're going to be THIS rude,[1] I'm simply going to leave.[0]
{3633}	[4][1]          So long...(chumps)![0]
{3634}	BOWSER: Listen YOU! Never EVER[1] talk to the leader of the Koopa[1] Troop like that! Ooh, I hate...[2] THAT! I'll ignore it this time...[1] but DON'T let it happen again![0]
{3635}	SHY AWAY: Eh?[12][12][1] Hey! Valentina ran away...[0]
{3636}	[4][1]      I shall fly the coop, too...[0]
{3637}	MALLOW: Uh...[12][12]I...[12]I think[1] we kind of missed the boat here...[0]
{3638}	 So...[12][12]...we'd better get[1] moving too!![2] C'mon, let's get 'em!![0]
{3639}	[1]            Hey, wait a sec...[0]
{3640}	[1]     It won't open...it's locked.[0]
{3641}	[1]       Ha! Here's how I'd do it.[0]
{3642}	[1]       Ha! Here's how I'd do it.[0]
{3643}	[1]       I'm absolutely exhausted![0]
{3644}	 I hate being a guard![2] Valentina only gives us the most[1] boring jobs to do!![0]
{3645}	[1] But I guess this beats Dodo's job.[0]
{3646}	 Dodo has to polish Valentina's[1] statues EVERY single day![0]
{3647}	[1]    Now THIS is how I would do it![0]
{3648}	 You need a key to open the[1] back door of the middle room...[2] But of course, Valentina's got it.[0]
{3649}	 I used to be a guard here, until[1] Valentina snatched away all my[1] keys...and gave me the boot.[3] Guess I won't be needing this[1] master key anymore...[1] Would you like it?[2] [7]  (Sure!)[1] [7]  (No thanks)[0]
{3650}	[4] All right, here you go![2] Just don't tell me what you're[1] gonna do with it, okay?[0]
{3651}	[4] Oh really?, You sure?[1] What a shame[12][12]...this precious key[1] opens the middle room, you know.[0]
{3652}	[1]     So...you don't want it, huh?[0]
{3653}	[1]         Wait! Don't say that![0]
{3654}	MALLOW: To be honest, we really[1] REALLY need it![0]
{3655}	[1]                Oh, yeah?[0]
{3656}	[1]    But HE said you didn't need it.[0]
{3657}	MALLOW: Oh, I'm sorry. You'll[1] have to excuse him, he...he's a[1] little shaken up right now.[0]
{3658}	[1]      [12]...Oh...[12]Okay...I guess...[12][5][6]
{3659}	MALLOW: Thank you![2] We owe you one![0]
{3660}	          Got “Castle Key 1”![0]
{3661}	 A dip in the hot springs would[1] perk up the King in a jiffy![0]
{3662}	[1]            Go on, take this...[0]
{3663}	 Hey! Did YOU know?![2] Valentina's got a huge egg[1] in the middle room.[3] It spits out eggs from time[1] to time, and sometimes when you[1] shield yourself, the eggs'll[2] ricochet off of you.[0]
{3664}	 Did you know that there are hot[1] springs around here?[2] [7]  (Yep)[1] [7]  (Nope)[0]
{3665}	[4] Aww, you're no fun.[1] I wanted to be the first[1] to tell you that![0]
{3666}	[4] We get special hot water from[1] Barrel Volcano. It helps cure all[1] kinds of ailments, but only the[2] King gets to bathe in it.[0]
{3667}	 Valentina told me to wait in this[1] room... I'm hoping she'll give me[1] a job soon...[0]
{3668}	 Hey, tell me something,[1] do statues[12][12]...[12]move?[0]
{3669}	[1]       No. Statues don't move.[0]
{3670}	[1]        Then[12][12]...[12]explain...[12][12]THIS![0]
{3671}	 It's...[12][12] one of those hi-tech,...[1] [12]er,...life-like..[12] realistic ones.[1] ...[12][12]Let's get outta here.[0]
{3672}	GARRO: Why are you back?![2] Come on! Put a little effort into[1] it, okay? Good luck![0]
{3673}	SHY AWAY: Oh[12][12] Oh[12][12]...[1] ...Busted...[2] What to do, what to do?[0]
{3674}	 I'll give you this “Fertilizer”[1] if you let me go~...[12][12][12]...OK?[0]
{3675}	 The hot springs are up ahead,[1] but only royalty can bathe there.[2] And you don't look so royal...![0]
{3676}	 Right now, Prince Mallow is[1] bathing in the hot springs.[1] It must be so relaxing.[0]
{3677}	[1]                DANGER!!![1]   Beyond the cliffs is the volcano[0]
{3678}	QUEEN NIMBUS: Hello, everyone.[2] Thank you so much for looking[1] after my dear child.[0]
{3679}	QUEEN NIMBUS: Hello, everyone.[2] Thank you so much for looking[1] after my dear child.[0]
{3680}	[1]        Wait a minute, please...[0]
{3681}	MALLOW: Please! These people[1] aren't your enemies. They're my[1] friends.[0]
{3682}	[1]           This way, come on![0]
{3683}	MALLOW: Mom...[13][48] Dad...[2] I'd like you to meet Mario...[0]
{3684}	[4][1]...and my other travel companions![0]
{3685}	KING NIMBUS: I say! How can[1] we ever thank you enough![2] I'm Mallow's father...King Nimbus.[0]
{3686}	MALLOW:[1]   Allow me to introduce everyone![0]
{3687}	 This...is Princess Toadstool from[1] Mushroom Kingdom...[0]
{3688}	KING NIMBUS: Ah![12] I've heard[1] so much about you! May I...[1] have your autograph?[0]
{3689}	QUEEN NIMBUS:[1]   Don't embarrass junior, dear!![0]
{3690}	KING NIMBUS: Oh![12]...FANTASTIC![2] (Show me again later...) Eh hem.[1] And WHO do we have over here?[0]
{3691}	MALLOW: This is Bowser, leader[1] of the Koopa Troop.[0]
{3692}	KING NIMBUS: Oh! Another famous[1] person! This is just too much![2] I MUST have YOUR autograph![0]
{3693}	QUEEN NIMBUS: Dear...behave[1] yourself, please![0]
{3694}	KING NIMBUS: No? Not even a[1] little scribble? Okay, okay...[0]
{3695}	KING NIMBUS: Yes, yes. I'm quite[1] forgetting my manners...[12][12]Well...[2] ...Who do we have over here?[0]
{3696}	MALLOW: This is Geno, who I told[1] you about before.[0]
{3697}	KING NIMBUS: Oh! Yes! That story[1] about the Star Street! How awful![0]
{3698}	GENO:[1]          That's...Star Road...[0]
{3699}	QUEEN NIMBUS: By the way, a little[1] before Valentina took over, a[1] large star fell into the volcano![0]
{3700}	KING NIMBUS: Hmm, but the dreaded[1] “Czar Dragon” inhabits the[1] volcano. It's going to be tough[2] getting a star out of there![0]
{3701}	[4] Hmmm...perhaps all of you[1] working together COULD handle[1] that beast...[0]
{3702}	[1] Why, when I was young, I...[0]
{3703}	QUEEN NIMBUS: Yes, dear...[2] Now, once at the volcano, find[1] Hinopio. He'll be able to help you.[0]
{3704}	QUEEN NIMBUS: You be careful,[1] Mallow![0]
{3705}	 Up ahead are the hot springs...[2] But only royalty is allowed...[0]
{3706}	 Hey! You're the REAL prince![3] Sorry about the misunderstanding[1] before...There's NO WAY that fat[1] bird could have been a Prince, huh?[0]
{3707}	 MALLOW: No big deal.[2]  Anyway, do you think you[1]  could let us through here?[0]
{3708}	[1]               Of course![0]
{3709}	 Go right ahead.[1] Please, enjoy yourselves.[2] But be careful not to fall into[1] the volcano.[0]
{3710}	 Please, enjoy yourselves.[2] But be careful not to fall into[1] the volcano.[0]
{3711}	KING NIMBUS: Oh! Nevermind...[0]
{3712}	[1] And, who is this gentleman here?[0]
{3713}	MALLOW: THIS[12]....[12]...[12][1] is Mario!!![2] He helped me from the start![0]
{3714}	KING NIMBUS: I sincerely thank you[1] from the bottom of my heart.[0]
{3715}	[4] [12]...[12]...[12]You don't mean...[1] THE Mario?! Jumping Mario?![1] Autograph, please![0]
{3716}	QUEEN NIMBUS:[1]     That's quite enough, dear...[0]
{3717}	KING NIMBUS: Okay, okay![12][12] Then...[1] how about showing me just a little[1] jump? A tiny hop will do![0]
{3718}	KING NIMBUS: Son, you're just[1] like me when I was your age.[1] I'm proud of you.[0]
{3719}	QUEEN NIMBUS: If you have[1] any problems, come straight[2] back, okay?![0]
{3720}	MALLOW: Okay, mom![2] But I probably won't come back[1] until we find the star![0]
{3721}	 Go up those steps, and you'll find[1] the royal bus that goes to the[1] volcano. It's pretty cool.[0]
{3722}	 Do you know about the royal bus?[2] [7]  (Yes)[1] [7]  (No)[0]
{3723}	[4] It's a regal vehicle, used only[1] by the King. It's parked now, due[1] to the fact he's ill...[0]
{3724}	[4] When the King recovers, I'll let[1] you see it. You see, I'm the[1] bus maintenance man.[0]
{3725}	[1]    The bus is undergoing repairs.[0]
{3726}	CROCO: Say, hey! We meet AGAIN![2] Dis here land is RICH! It's got[1] tons of loot, and I want it all![5][6]
{3727}	[4] So, youse guys found 'em ALL?[1] ...[12]Geez...[12][12]I've failed...[1][12][12] ...I'm humiliated...![0]
{3728}	[4] So, youse guys found 'em ALL?[1] ...[12]Geez...[12][12]I've failed...[1][12][12] ...I'm humiliated...![0]
{3729}	 Welcome! Come on in![1] So you want to take a rest?[1] I'm sure that's why you're here.[3] It'll be [28][1] coins a night.[2] [7]  (OK, I'll take a break)[1] [7]  (I'll pass)[0]
{3730}	[4] Let me guess...you want to use[1] this “Dream Cushion” to rest,[1] right? That'll be 30 more coins.[2] [7]  (I'll try anything once)[1] [7]  (Looks pretty weird)[0]
{3731}	[4] Seems like you don't have[1] enough money. Come back again.[0]
{3732}	[1]              Oh, shut up.[0]
{3733}	[1]         Don't talk to me now.[0]
{3734}	 Oh, now look![2] I lost 'cause of YOU![0]
{3735}	 Wait, hold on![2] This is the highest score...[0]
{3736}	 Oh, wait,[12] [12]wait[12]...[0]
{3737}	  All right! YES!![2] ...I'm done here.[0]
{3738}	 You want this?[1] It's only 500 coins.[2] [7]  (Well, sure!)[1] [7]  (No)[0]
{3739}	[4][1]              Suit yourself.[0]
{3740}	[4][1]         You need more coinage.[0]
{3741}	[4][1]         You need more coinage.[0]
{3742}	 Want me to teach you?[2] [7]  (Yes, please)[1] [7]  (I already know)[0]
{3743}	[4][1]          Aww, you're no fun.[0]
{3744}	[4] High score if you hit[1] the shells with the stars[1] fired from the beetle.[2] If you get hit, recover by firing[1] consecutively...Just do it![0]
{3745}	[1]   I order you to stand before me.[0]
{3746}	[1]       I now order you to jump.[0]
{3747}	[4] In this world, there are things[1] called “hidden treasures”.[2] Use your awesome jumping ability[1] to look for 'em.[0]
{3748}	[1]    I wish you luck in the future.[0]
{3749}	 Mario![5][6]
{3750}	[1] The Chancellor has filled me in![1] Come. Let me show you around.[0]
{3751}	[1]   Help yourself to the treasures![0]
{3752}	 If you leave now, what will that[1] do to my reputation?![0]
{3753}	 This is a “Flower”. The more you[1] gather, the more Flower Points[1] you'll have in battle. [5]Find 'em![0]
{3754}	 THIS mushroom will restore your[1] Hit Points and Flower Points.[2] Unfortunately, mushrooms you find[1] as items only restore your HP.[2] So beware.[0]
{3755}	 This is a “Coin”.[1] The small ones are worth one, and[1] the large ones are worth ten.[2] This one's a “10”![0]
{3756}	[1]          I'm standing guard![0]
{3757}	 Do you know about Flower Points?[1] [7]  (No! Tell me!)[1] [7]  (Yes)[0]
{3758}	[4] You sure got your[1] act together, Mario![0]
{3759}	[4] You sure got your[1] act together, Mario![0]
{3760}	 We're all able to serve the[1] King again.[3] But we left our houses wide open.[1] Hope everything's all right.[0]
{3761}	 Came to see the King's statue[1] collection. I tell you, it's[1] remarkable![0]
{3762}	 Wonder when the bus is gonna[1] start again? They're probably[1] repairing it as we talk.[0]
{3763}	 Things have finally picked up![0]
{3764}	 The King's happier than ever[1] after being reunited with Mallow.[0]
{3765}	 What happened to Valentina?[2] She must have landed near the sky[1] after she flew the coop...[0]
{3766}	 Morning![1] Did you have pleasant dreams?[5][6]
{3767}	 Morning![1] Did you have pleasant dreams?[5][6]
{3768}	[1] That's odd[12]...[12][12][1] It smells like pepper in here![1] Probably just my imagination![0]
{3769}	[1] It looked like you had nightmares.[1] Is everything okay?[0]
{3770}	[1] When you hear laughter,[1] you know it's a good dream![0]
{3771}	[1] You slept quietly, so I'm sure[1] you had pleasant dreams![0]
{3772}	[4][1]        Please come back again![0]
{3773}	[4][1]          Kick back and relax![0]
{3774}	[4] Hey, wait a sec.[1] You don't have enough money, so[1] I can't let you use the cushion.[0]
{3775}	[4] Good dreams are fun[1] entertainment![0]
{3776}	 People have been visiting us from[1] the world down under.[2] Even Croco came.[0]
{3777}	 Croco passed by, earlier.[2] He was saying,“ MINE, ALL MINE!”[1][12] What was that all about?[0]
{3778}	 I just saw a Mushroom person.[2] You'll find him at the inn.[0]
{3779}	 We can finally go in the castle.[2] The King seems just fine![0]
{3780}	 The King must be overjoyed,[1] having Prince Mallow back.[0]
{3781}	 I'm so relieved the King[1] wasn't ill...[2] And hurrah for our Prince![0]
{3782}	 Now that we can go into the[1] castle again, I think I'll go check[1] out some statues.[0]
{3783}	GARRO: Prince Mallow![2] That was splendid work![1] You are every bit a “prince”![0]
{3784}	MALLOW: If it weren't for you,[1] Garro, we'd never have[1] pulled it off![2] We definitely owe you one![0]
{3785}	GARRO: Thanks, Mallow.[0]
{3786}	GARRO: (I'm really glad everything[1] worked out...)[0]
{3787}	GARRO: Mallow, you ARE indeed,[1] a TRUE PRINCE!![0]
{3788}	[1]    The royal bus is running again![0]
{3789}	 Everyone's happy when the[1] weather is nice![0]
{3790}	 Oh yeah![2] I saw Valentina going towards the[1] building to the south...[2] I wonder why?[0]
{3791}	MALLOW: Mom![12][12] Dad![0]
{3792}	QUEEN NIMBUS: Were you able to[1] find the star, dear?[0]
{3793}	MALLOW: Yeah. The Axem Rangers[1] took it away from us, but...[2] we got it back again![0]
{3794}	KING NIMBUS: That's wonderful![2] Now the Star, uh[12][12]...Star Thing[1] can be repaired, right?[0]
{3795}	 I guess not...[12][12]You're...[12][12]still...[1] missing a piece, I take it.[0]
{3796}	 I guess this is goodbye.[0]
{3797}	TOAD: Mario![0]
{3798}	 Are you all right?[0]
{3799}	 You were kicking up a sweat...[2] Here, drink this and blow those[1] bad guys away.[0]
{3800}	TOAD: Ya! Ya![0]
{3801}	 Mario...[2] I've kept this a secret until now,[1] but...[12][12]I'm really[12][12] a...[12][12]a...[0]
{3802}	[1]              a MONSTER!!![0]
{3803}	GAZ:[1]    Geno, come on, you can do it![0]
{3804}	YOSHI:[1]          (Mario! Good luck!)[0]
{3805}	CHANCELLOR:[1]    We're counting on you, Mario![0]
{3806}	 Boing, boing, boing![1] I'm trying really hard, so Mario,[1] you have to try hard, too![0]
{3807}	[1]       I'm with you all the way![0]
{3808}	[1]    Here it comes, here it comes![0]
{3809}	 The bus has finally been repaired.[2] We can start operating again.[0]
{3810}	[1] ..[12]..[12]..[12] Prince Mallow![0]
{3811}	MALLOW: We want to go to[1] Bowser's Keep...Could you[1] give us a lift, please?[0]
{3812}	 I've heard the story from[1] King Nimbus.[2] You'll be there in no time![0]
{3813}	[1]    So, how's the engine running?[0]
{3814}	[1]   Oh, it's purring like a kitten![0]
{3815}	 Could you take Prince Mallow[1] to the entrance of Bowser's Keep?[0]
{3816}	 Of course![12][12] Can't wait to get[1] this thing running again![5][1] Come, Prince, hop on board.[0]
{3817}	[1]               All aboard![0]
{3818}	[1]               We're off![0]
{3819}	       Found a “[26]”![0]
{3820}	         Got “Castle Key 2”![0]
{3821}	         Got “Castle Key 2”![0]
{3822}	         Got “Castle Key 2”![0]
{3823}	         Got “Castle Key 2”![0]
{3824}	         Got “Castle Key 2”![0]
{3825}	[4] But hey, I'm not sweatin'![1] This device'll tell me where[1] the treasures are hidden![3] The rest of 'em are mine![1] All MINE!! Adios, fools![0]
{3826}	 Found a “Signal Ring”![2] If you equip it, it'll ring at[1] the location of a hidden treasure.[0]
